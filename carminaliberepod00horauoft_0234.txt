190 HORApE, ODES Ι. xxiv—xxv.

1. desiderio is ‘regret' for something lost.

sit, ‘need there be.' Cf. such expressions as quis putet, quis dubitet
(Ixoby, Lat. Gr ἓ 1538).

2. capitis. Cs. nec te, dulce caput, laesi Prop. v. 11. 55 and the
Greek use of κάρα.

d· praecipe, ‘set a song of mourning.’ praecipere is to teach by
letation.

3. Melpomene, cf. 1. 1. 33 n.

5. ergo, used, as a kind of sigh, to introduce a mournful exclama·
tion. Cf. Sat. 11. 5. 101 ergo nunc Dama sodalis Nusquam est! Ovid
T rzst 111. ι. 1 ergo erat in fatis Scythiam quoque virere nostris. The
exact English equivalent, in such a position, is ‘.and' Cf. Hood’ 5

‘And is lte gone, and is he gone?
Slze crzed and wept outrigllt.

6. urget, ‘lies heavy on.' Cf. lv. 9. 27 urgentur,...longa nocte.

7. mcor-rupta, ‘incorruptible.’ So invictus=invincible; illaudatus
(Georg. 111. 5)=detestable.

rides, ‘.honesty ' Cf. Cic. de Off. 1. 7. 2 3 fundamentum tustitz‘ae
est fides, id est dzctorum conventorumque constantia et veretas.

8. inveniet, sing. for plural, as in 1. 3. 3.

parem, ‘his peer,' as in Milton, Lycidas, 8, ‘For Lycidas is dead,
dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not lest his peen'

9. flebilis, ‘':bewept like illacrzmabiles ‘’unwept in ιν. 9. 26.
This usage is the converse of that in incorrupta, supra, l. 6-

11,12. tu frustra... ..deos There are several difficulties here.

(ι) Most editors take frustra with pius, but some with poscis. The
emphatic tu favours the former opinion, for the sense appears to be
‘y0u‚ such is your grief, actually ask sor Quintilius to be restored to

life) Probably pius means ‘affectionatess and frustra pius, ‘with
useless fidelity!

(2) non ita creditum. Here creditum may mean ‘entrusted to the
gods, ' as if Vergil had once committed Quintilius to their care (cf. 1. 3.
5): οι· ‘entrusted to you? as if the gods had lent Quintilius to Vergil

for a time. It might be suggested, againi that creditum means ‘lendable'
(credibilem so to say) like mcorrupta inl 6.

(3) 1ta' is usually interpreted sub hac condicaQone, but the condition is
not clear. It may mean ‘not entrusted to the gods to keep' or ‘not en-
trusted to you to keep for ever, ’or ‘not entrusted to you, for all your
piety‚’ or ‘not entrusted to you, for all your tearsss

pffiostgate (and ap arently Wickham)h think non ita creditum means
