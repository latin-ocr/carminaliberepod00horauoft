166 HORACE, ODES 1. vii—ix.

uda Lyaeo tempora, ‘ temples moist with wine.’ Similar expressions
are not uncommon: e.g. multo perfusum tempora Baccho in Tibullus
(1. 2. 3): and it would seem that they may be taken literally, though
udus and uvidus sometimes mean ‘tipsy' (as in ΙΙ. 19. 18, 1v. 5. 39).
Perhaps the garlands of drinkers were dipped in wine.

2 3. populea. The poplar was sacred to Hercules, the wanderer
(vagus 111. 3. 9) and the guide of wanderers (ἡγεμών, Xen. Anah. lv.

8. 25).

25. quo...cumque. Cf. 1. 6. 3. A proverbial saying patria est
ubicumque est bene was ascribed to Teucer (Cic. Tusc. v. 37. 108).

27. ¹1¹. duee et auspice ¹1¹„ abl. abs. A Roman commander was
usually dux and auspex to his troops (cf. qui ductu auspicioque eius rem
⁴ prospere gesserant, Livy v. 46. 6) : though sometimes a superior magistrate
took the auspices on opening a campaign, leaving the command of it to

a subordinate.
The word auspex properly means ‘ one who watches the birds' and

takes auspices, but it often means the -god who gives auspices, the
‘patron’ of the undertaking (eg. auspice Musa in Epist. 1. 3. 13).
Hence some editors read here auspice Teucri, renderin the words
‘ under the guidance of Teucer and Teucer's patron (Apolloffl

28. certus, ⁴ unerring,’ νημερτής.

29· ambiguam...sa1am1na, ‘a Salamis to dispute the name’ (Wick-
’ ham). The Salamis founded by Teucer was in Cyprus.

30. peioraque passi, cf. Verg. Aen. 1. 199 o passi graviora, dabit
deus his quoque finem.

32. iterabimus, ‘we will plough again’ (cf. 1. 34. 4). Teucer had
just returned from Troy. ·

Ode vm.

To Lydia, another ‘light o’ love,' who is addressed also in 1.⁴ 18 and
111. 9.

Schemc. Lydia, you are ruining the lise of Sybaris. He, who was
so famous an athlete, is seen no more in the field. You keep him in
hiding as Thetis kept Achilles.

Metre. Greater Sapphic (Introd. p. xxx), not used again by Horace.

⁶ .4· campum, the Campus Martius, where Roman youths practised
military sports.

patiens, ‘though fit to endure.’ Cf. Juy. vu. 33 aetas et pelagi

patiens et cassidis· atque ligonis. For the omission of quamvis cf. 1. 32.
6 (ferox bello).

5. militans, nom. sing. ‘as a soldier’: not acc. plur.

6. aulica ora. The Romans preferred the horses of Gaul, and

§l— many of the Roman ‘horsey' terms are Gallie: e.g. mannus, caballus,
petor? etum, essedum, Epona.
