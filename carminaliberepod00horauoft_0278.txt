Note.

The following quaint version of this ode was addressed by the Earl
of Surrey to Sir Thomas Wyatt. It was printed in 1557 and is the
earliest known translation of Horace into English verse.

‘of thy life, Thomas, this compass well mark:
, Not aye with full sails the high seas to beat;
Ne by coward dread, in shunning storms dark,
On shallow shores thy keel in peril freat (damage).

Whoso gladly halseth (embraceth) the golden mean,
Void of dangers advisedly hath his home;

Not with loathsome muck as a den unclean,

Nor palace·like, whereat disdain ma‘y glome (seowl).

The losty pine the great wind often rives3

With violenter sway fall turrets steep;

Lightnings assault the high mountains and clives (cliffs).
A heart well stay’d, in overthwartes deep,

Hopeth amends: in sweet, doth sear the sour-
God that sendeth, withdraweth winter sharp.
Now ill, not aye thus: once Phoebus to low’r,
With bow nubent, shall cease and frame to harp

His voice; in strait estate appear thou stout ;
And so wisely, when lucky gale of wind

All thy puft sails shall fill, look well about 3
Take in a reef : haste is waste, proof doth find!

Ode ΧΙ.

To Quinctius Hirpinus, of whom nothing is known. Possibly
Epist. 1. 16 is also addressed to him.

Scheme. Dismiss thoughts of politics and business, Quinctius. Our
youth is waning fast: why waste it on insoluble problems? It is
better to lie in the shade and drink and listen to songs.

Metre. Alcaic.

1. cantaber. The date is probably Ec. 25, when Augustus was
called into Spain by a rising of the Cantabri.

Scythes. The reference is not now understood. See the last note
on 11. 9.

2. Hadria divisus obiecto. This is added to show the remoteness
of the Scythian and so, by implication, of the Cantabrian. obiecto
means ‘lying in the way.’

3. remittas, ‘ drop‚’ ‘leave off!
