232 HORACE, ODEs 11. ix, x.

Μ. Vinicius, having conquered certain Celtic tribes, surrendered the
title of Imperator to Augustus. For these victories a triumph was
offered to Augustus, but he refused it. The senate thereupon decreed
that a triumphal arch should be erected in his honour near the Alps
and that he should be allowed to wear the triumphal robes and crown
on the first day of each year. The arch may have been exchanged
for that more elaborate monument (finished B.c. 7 or 6) which was
always called Tropaea Augusti (Pliny H. Ν. 111. 20. 136 and Ptolemy
111. 1) and was still existing in the Middle Ages at Turbia (the name is a
corruption of Tropaea) in Monaco. (Prof. Mommsen, however, believes
that an arch was really erected and that it stands at Aosta. But the
inscriptions on the arch at Aosta are entirely lost and there is no means
of knowing its origin. See C. I. L. v. pp. 797, 907 and Mommsen,
Res Gestae2‚ p. 104.) However this may be, some monument was
certainly projected in B.c. 25 and the formal language of nova tropaea
Augusti Caesaris in Horace seems likely to refer to it. It should be
,added that, in B.C. 2 5, the temple of Janus was closed for the second
time in the reign of Augustus and the fourth time in the history of
Rome.

The precise meaning of the allusions to Armenia is not known, but
there is evidence that important events took place in that part of the
world in B.C. 25. There are extant coins bearing the inscription
Armenia Capta Aug. Imp. VJJJ„ and Augustus was saluted imperator
sor the eighth tirne in B.C. α 5.

As to the Geloni, in the Monum. Ancyr. Augustus says (column v.
51- 5 3) nostram amicitiam ultro petierunt per legatos Bastarnae Scythae-

named in their geographical order from the Danube eastward across the
Caucasus to Parthia. The Sarmatae are said to be identical with the
Geloni. It happens that Orosius (vl. 21. 19) says that Augustus
received an embassy of Scythians at Tarraco where he lay ill in B.c. 25,
and it appears from the epitomes of Livy 134 and 135 that M. Crassus
was fighting against the Bastarnae, Moesi and other peoples in their
neighbourhood in B.c. 26 and 25.

p. 303. It is noticeable that the next ode is addressed to Varro, whose
victory over the Salassi was one of the great events of B.c. 25. This

thread ”pf connexion between the odes is quite Horatian (Introd.

Ode Χ.

To L. Licinius Murena, adopted by A. Terentius Varro and there-
fore properly called A. Terentius Varro Murena. By this adoption, he
became brother to Terentia, wife of Maecenas, and to Proculeius
(named in 11. 2. 5). He conquered the Salassi, an Alpine tribe, in
13.c. 25 and founded the colony of Augusta Praetorianorum (now
Aosta). In B.c. 22 he conspired against Augustus with Fannius
