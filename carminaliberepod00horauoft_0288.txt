244 HORACE, onEs 11. xv, xvi.

18. oppida, perhaps plur. sor sing„ ‘the town’ 1.8. Rome.
19. iubentes, ‘ though they commanded.’

20. novo saxo, ‘ fresh-cut stone.’ The two ablatives publico

sumptu dand novo saxa, both qualifying decorare, are ingeniously
separate .

Ode XVl.

To Grosphus, doubtless the same as Pompeius Grosphus, whom
Horace strongly recommends as an honest man (Epist. 1. 12. 22) to his
friend Iccius. The expression Siculae vaccae in 1. 33 and the fact that
Iccius was in Sicily when the Epistle was written, show that Grosphus
had estates in that island. He seems to have complained to Horace
either of the cares of office or of the anxiety of a contested election.

Scheme. All men pray for peace, a blessing that cannot be won by
any riches. For cares osten haunt the great and are often absent from
the humble. What is the use of creating anxieties for ourselves and
then trying to avoid them? Let the mind, when it is happy, avoid
thoughts of the future and let it accept adversity with a smile. There
is no lot which has not its bitterness. You are rich (but harassed by
anxiety): I am poor, but I have my vein of poesy and a fine contempt
for the malicious mob.

Metre. Sapphic-

1. otium, cf. 1. 1. 15-17 luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum
Mercator metuens otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui. The word otium is

used in different senses by the man of action and the philosopher. To
the latter it means ἀταραξία, ⁴ peace of mind.'

2. prensus=deprensus, ‘ caught,’ ‘ overtaken.’ Either the sailor
or the merchant is meant.

3. certa, ‘sure-guiding.’ Cf. Tibullus 1. 9. 10 ducunt instabiles
sidera certa rates.

5. bello furiosa, ‘raging with war' i-e. where war rages. There
was a campaign in Thrace for which M. Licinius Crassus received a
triumph in July B.c. 273 but it would appear, from the epitome of Livy
cxxxv, that the same Crassus conducted another' Thracian campaign
somewhat later. The reference to Thrace and the Medes together is

similar to that in 111. 8, which ode is assigned to B.c. 28 or 24. See
on 11. 9.

6. Medi, ‘the Parthians‚' as in 1. α. 51. They pray for peace
while they are equipped sor war.

7. purpura seems to be the consular purple, the toga praetexta.
The word venale does not imply purchase or exchange, but means only
‘ procurable.' Cf. morte venalem laurum in 111. 14. 2.

venale. For the division of the word cf. 1. 2. 20 and 25. 11.

10. summovet, the technical word for the action of lictors, who
‘shouldered' the crowd from the path of the magistrate.
