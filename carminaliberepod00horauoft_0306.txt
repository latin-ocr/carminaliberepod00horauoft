262 HORACE, oDEs 111. ii.

The ode instructs the rising generation in their duty to the state.
They are to be strenuous in war and faithful in counsel.

1. angustam pauperiem: the link between the last ode and this.
Ode 1. exhorts to frugality by showing the uselessness of riches: Ode ΙΙ.
shows how frugality may be learnt and the use of it. Cf. 111. 24.
51—54 Eradenda cupidinis Pravi sunt elementa, immediately followed
by et tenerae nimis Mentes asperioribus Formandae studiis.

pauperiem, like paupertas in Ι. 12. 43, is not want (egestas), but
narrow means.

amice adv. (not vocative noun).

2. robustus = corroboratus, predicative: ‘by being hai-dened.’
‘May the boy learn to take kindly to the pinch of poverty by being
hardened in the stern school of warfare.'

3. condiscat, optative, like suspiret in l. 9.
4. eques. The expression is curious, for there was practically no

Italian cavalry in B.c. 27. The reference is probably to a prcy'ect of
Augustus for raising cavalry in Italy to fight the Parthians.

⁴ 5. sub divo=sub love (Ι. 1. 25), ‘ in the open air.’

L· trepidis in rebus, ‘in scenes of peril,† a favourite expression of
iv .
ἕ. hosticis, cf. civicum in 11. 1. 1. The scene, of women watching

a battle from the ramparts, is common in Greek poetry. So also in
Aeneid XI. 475 tum muros varia cinxere corona Matronae puerique.

8. adulta virgo, the daughter of the bellans tyrannus and the
betrothed of some princely ally.

9. suspiret, eheu. The sense is ‘may she breathe an anxious
prayer lest! eheu is her actual sigh, and suspiret eheu conveys an idea
of fear, on which ne lacessat etc. depends. The prayer is appropriate
only in the mouth of the virgv, not in that of ‚the matrona. In
English, therefore, some alteration of the construction must be made:
e.g. ‘ Watching him from the hostile ramparts beside lter mother, may
the maiden‚ ripe daughter of the warring tyrant ' etc.

ne lacessat is sometimes taken 'as oratio recta ε ‘ Ah l may my royal
lover not provoke ' etc„ but the young lady is not likely to speak of her
lover as regius or as rudis agminum.

10. asperum tactu, ⁶ dangerous to touch?

13. dulce...mori. This and the following lines are common-
places of Greek poets. Cf. Tyrtaeus:

τεθνάμεναι ’γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι πεσόντα
ἄνδρ’ ἀγαθὸν περὶ ᾖ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον t
and Simonides : .
ὁ δ’ αὖ θάνατος κίχε καὶ τὸν φυτγόμαχον.
Several other passages of the same kind are quoted.

16. poplitibus, the houghs or ham-strings. In Livy XXII. 48 the
Numidians at Cannae are described as pursuing the Romans, terga
ferientes et poplites caedentes. ·
