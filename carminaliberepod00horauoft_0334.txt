290 HORACE, ODES 111. xii—xiv.

Metre. A stanza consisting of ten feet called Ionici a minore.
Each foot is of the form νν--. The last syllable cannot be doubtful,
but must be long even at the end of the stanza. The lines have been
arranged in various ways, to suit the convenience of the copyist or the
printer. (Obs. the ionicus a maiore begins with the long syllables,
thus, --νν.)

1. miserarum est. The emphasis is on the 'genden ‘ It is the lot
of us poor girls,’ as distinguished from the luckier male sex·

dare ludum, ‘to give play to,' ‘to indulge.’ Cf. Cic. pro Caelia,
28 datur comessa omnium huic aliquis ludus aetati.

nefas aut pretium est mori.

3. patruae linguae, ‘the lash of an uncle’s tongue‚’ was notoriously

tinguit aqua.
