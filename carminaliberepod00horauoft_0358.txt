314 HORACE, ODES 111. xxvii.

The omens just enumerated (except the first) were called by the
Romans pedestria auspicia, because they were given by creatures on the
ground. Next follow some omens ex avibus.

ego eui timebo, in effect ‘for any friend of mine,' opposed to the
impios of l. 1. cui ego timebo :pro eo cuius saluti ego timebo.

9. antequam, in effect: ‘I will try to raise a good omen before the
bad one happens! The good omen would neutralise a subsequent bad
one.

10. avis. The raven, annosa cornix of 111. 17. 13, where see

note. flz'vina, ‘prophetic,’ with gen. as in Ars Poet. 218 divina futuri
sententia.

1 r. oscinem, ‘oracular.' Those birds were oscines which gave
omens by the voice: those alites which gave omens by their flight.
For the crow cf. Livy x. 40 ante consulem llaec dicentem corvus voce
clara occinuit, quo laetus augurio consul etc.

12. solis ab ortuae Good omens came from the eastern sky. The
Romans, in taking auspices, faced the south, so that good omens carne
to them from the left side. The Greeks faced the north, so that to them
left-hand omens were bad.

13. sis licet felix. It must be imagined that, between the 3rd and
4th stanzas, the poet has taken auspices and found them favourable.
Then he proceeds z ‘ You may be happy wherever you choose,’ i.e. you
may go wherever you like.

14. vivas, a wish, not dependent on licet. In effect ‘Goodbye and
remember me.'

15. laevus, ‘ill- omened. ’ Augustan poets‘ frequently imitate the

Greeks ln using laevus or smzkter of bad omens, though the lest hand '

was, to Roman augurs‚ the favourable side.

bl 17. quanto trepidet tumultu, ‘with what turmoil setting Orion
usters!

18. pronus orion=devexus Orion, cf. 1. 28. 21. Orion set in the
morning early' m November.

The omens are good, says Horace, but what about the time of year?
A voyage at this season is bound to be perilous.

ater, ‘when it blackens' ε cf. aspera Μζξνὶε aequora ventis 1. 5. 6.

19.n0v1‚‘1 know by experience.’ Horace perhaps had been
ffizsgliltstaltl ‘1³:4thth (see Epode 9) and had certainly once been near ship-

albus,‘ for all its clear skies.’ The Iapyx was the favourable wind
for crossing to Epirus (1. 3. 4), but it was osten too boisterous. For
albus cf. Albus ut obscuro deterget nubila caelo Saepe Notus in 1. 7. 15.
Also candidi 111. 7. 1.

21. hostium, cf. Verg. Georg. 111. 1 15 di meliora piis erroremque
hostibus illum.

caecos, probably ‘blind with sury.’ Orelli takes it as=inscrutable‚
cf. Α eneid 111. 200 caecis erramus in undis. —
