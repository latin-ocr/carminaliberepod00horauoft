364 HoRACE, EPODE 1.

The first 10 Epodes are written in the same mette, a couplet
consisting of an ordinary iambic trimeter, followed by an iambic
dimeter. The scheme, as employed by Horace, is as follows:

(1) For the longer line (trimeter):

§.r— ν- v— hd— ν.- vg

*vv &vv νυν ννν

 

 

 

 

 

-vv —vv

vv—

The caesura occurs either in the third foot or in the fourth.
Tribrachs, dactyls and anapaests occur rarely, only 31 times altogether
in 311 lines. (Ramsay, Latin Prosody‚ p. 193.)

(2) For the shorter line (dimeter), the scheme is the same as sor the

ι last four feet of the longer.

Epode 11 is in a metre called the Third Archilochian, consisting of
an iambic trimeter followed by an Elegiambus of the form

-vvl-vvlg'v—lv-lz-¹v=··

It will be seen that this is a combination of the second half of an
elegiae pentameter with an iambic dimeter. The combination is
asynartete (i.e. imperfectly joined), for the last syllable of the first
portion is not affected in scansion by the first syllable of the second
portion (see lines 6 and 14).

Epode 12 is in the metre called Alcmanian (employed in Carm. 1.
7 and 28), consisting of couplets of dactylic hexameters and tetra-
meters.

Epode 13 is in the Second Archilochian, composed of a dactylic
hexameter followed by an lambelegus of the form

0
ν-ν-Σ-νὲ Ι -vv ι-υνιζ.

This is a combination, in reverse order, of the same parts as the
elegiambic. It is also asynartete.

Epodes 14 and t 5 are in Pythiambic couplets, consisting of a dactylic
hexameter followed by an iambic dimeter (of pure iambics).

Epode 16 is in Pythiambic couplets of another kind, consisting of a
dactylic hexameter followed by an iambic trimeter (of pure iambics).
(The word pytlzz'ambic is derived from pythius, a name given to the
hexameter because it was the mette used in the Pythian, 1.e. Delphic,
oracles.) ’

Epode 17 is not properly called an epode, for it is in lines of
uniform scansion, viz. iambic trimeters.

‘You are going, Maecenas, to sace the ponderous warships of
the enemy. I am resolved to go with you. For I love you so much
that Ι cannot be happy save in your company.’

It is clear from line 31 that this Epode was written after B.c. 35
when Maecenas had given the poet his Sabine farm (Introd. p. xiii).
The diction of lines 1 and 2 leaves no reasonable doubt that Maecenas
