x1i INTRODUCTION.,

Soon after the battle, Horace appears to have obtained a
pardon from Octavianus and leave to return to Rome. He
seems to have travelled nearly all the way by sea and suffered
shipwreck, or came near it, at Mons Palinurus on the Lucanian
coastl. His father was by this time dead, and when he reached
Rome, he found himself penniless2. It is said that he managed
to procure a situation as clerk in some department of the public
treasury³ and that he held this office for about four years
(B.C. 41—37). Horace himself says that poverty drove him to
making verses²‚ but it is unlikely that he found poetry a source
of income. More probably he had introductions to some
conservative (i.e. republican> coteries, and used his literary
talents to make himself welcome, in spite of his poverty. No
other society would have received with favour, at that time,
such denunciations of civil war as Epodes 7 and 16, two of
Horace's earliest pieces.

The compositions of Horace at this period were undoubtedly
either satires in the manner of Lucilius (died B.C. 103), or
iambic epodes, mostly satirical‚ in the manner of Archilochus
of Paros* (flor. B.c. 700). Through these, probably, he obtained
the- acquaintance of L. Varius and Vergil, who became his fast
friends and introduced him to Maecenas ⁶. Some nine months

¹ carm. 111. 4. 28 and 27. 18.

² Epist. 11. 2. 49—52. (unde simul primum me dimisere Philippi, Ι
decisis humilem pennis inopemque paterni Ι et laris et fundi paupertas
impulit audax Ι ut versus facerem.)

⁸ The authorities are Suetonius, who says scriptum quaestorium
comparavit, and the scholiasts to Sat. 11. 6. 36.

⁴ Epist. 1. 19. 23—2 5 (Parios ego primus iambos Ι ostendi Latio).
The oldest of the published works is Sat. 1. 7, which seems to have
been written in 13.c. 43 or early in 42. Epode 16 seems to have been
written on hearing the news of the capture of Perusia, B.c. 40. Sat. 1.
α and 4 were written before Horace became intimate with Maecenas,
Epode 7 is assigned to B.C. 36.

⁶ Sat. 1. 6. 54, 55 (optimus olim Ι Vergilius, post hunc Varius dixere
quid essem).
