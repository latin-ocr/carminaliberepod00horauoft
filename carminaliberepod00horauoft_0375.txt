²4· quod is cognate object to spiro and placeo. ‘The music that
1 breathe and the pleasure that 1 give (or ‘the applause that I win') are
thine.’

ΒΡΠο-ττνέω, to make music (properly on the flute): cf. 11. 16. 38 n.,
IV. 6. 29 and Anth. Pal. vn. no. 407 where Dioscorides speaks of Sappho
as lca πνείουσαν ἐκείναις (Πιερίσιν). Orelli, who gives this quotation,
thinks quod spiro means ‘the fact that I am inspired.'

Ode Ν.

This ode was written, by command of Augustus (Introd. p. xiv), to
celebrate the conquest of the Rhaeti by Nero Claudius Drusus in ΒΩ.

Augustus was in Gaul. The Rhaeti occupied the Eastern Alps in the
neighbourhood of Innspruck and Verona: the Vindelici dwelt to the

Scheme. Like an eagle or a young lion, Drusus pounced on the
Rhaeti. Their savage hordes succumbed to a man whom his blood and
trainiug had alike prepared sor conquest. Romans, when you think of
the Neros, remember the great day of the Metaurus and Hannibal’s cry

of despair.
Mare. Alcaic.

1. quum—antem. The accus. is governed by propulit and the
other verbs of 11. 6-12. The simile is unusually awkward because parts
of it (11. 5-9), which are sor the moment irrelevant, are inextricably
complicated with the relevant part. In translation, a parenthesis must
be made: ‘ Like the winged guardian of the thunderbolt, whom

Tite protasis continues to 1. 16: in effect qualis aquila est vel leo, talem

ready sor the god to hurl. Hence Vergil Aeneid v. 255 calls him Iovis
armager.

alitem, adj. like ales Pegasus lv. 1 1. 26.

4. in mmm, ‘in the matter of Ganymede' whom the'eagle
snatched from Troy to be Jove’s cupbearer.

5. olim iuventas etc. The eagle’s early progress is something like
that of Drusus, but it is irrelevant .to the present comparison, which is
that of the eagle's swoop to Drusus' descent on the Rhaeti.
