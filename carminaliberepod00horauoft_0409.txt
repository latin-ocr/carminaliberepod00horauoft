α. propag-nacula. Many authorities relate that Antony' s ships at
Actium were mostly of huge size, having from six to nine or ten banks

Actium (Aen. vul. 691) says pelago credas innare revulsas Cycladas,

the author of an elegy on Maecenas (attributed reasonably to the first
century) says of him cum freta Nilmcae texerunt laeta carinae, Fortis
erat circum sortis et ante ducem. Dion Cassius (L1.3) says that
Maecenas had charge of Rome and Italy 1n the absence of Augustus,
but this appears to have been after the battle.
