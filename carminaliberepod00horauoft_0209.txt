NOTEs. 165

7. undique...onvam The poet assumes the garland of the god
whom he celebrates. Thus the poet of wine wears the ivy of Bacchus
(ιιι. 25. 20) and the poet of love wears the myrtle of Venus (cf. 1. 38.
5 and Ovid Am. 1. 1. 29). So he who sings of Pallas, will wear the
olive which was sacred to Pallas Athena, who created it.

undique decerptam probably means ‘ plucked from every spot‚' as if
the poet celebrated every nook and corner of Athenian soil. The
version ‘ plucked by everybody' is not suitable, for the point of the lines
is that only some poets celebrate Athens.

8. plurimus, in the sense of plurimi, is not found elsewhere
without a subst. (e.g. plurimus oleaster Vergil Georg. 11. 182) ε but there
is one clear instance of multus=multi in Lucan (Phars. 111. 707 multus
sua vulnera puppi affixit moriens). Many scholars, however, reading
platinam· in I. honore translate ‘he who is devoted to the honour of
Juno‚’ comparing such expressions as totus in illis (nugis) Sat. 1. 9. 2,
omnis in hoc sum Ep. 1. ι. ιι, multus esse in re nota Cic. de Or. 11. 87.

η. Albuneae mantin. Albunea, properly the name of the
Sibyl, is here a plied to her temple or grotto, which ‘echoes’ with the
root os the salig. So Verg. Aen. vn. 82 speaks of another Albunea,
morum quae mamma sacrofonte sonat.
