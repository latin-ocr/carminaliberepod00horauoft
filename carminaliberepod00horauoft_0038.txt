xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

Most of the oldest MSS. have been inspected by more than
one editor, butxthe fullest collation will be found in the editions
of O. Keller and A. Holder (see esp. their editio minor of 1879).

The text of Horace presented in these MSS. is not in a
satisfactory statez' that is to say, it leaves grave doubt, in very
many places, as to what Horace really wrote. Apart from the
numerous passages where we have two alternative readings,
both good (see next page), there are places where there are
alternatives both bad (e.g. 111. 4. 10 limen Apuliae, or 111. 24.
4 mare Apulz'cum, or Epod. 9. 17 ad bunc), and places where
the MSS. are agreed but the reading can hardly be sound (e.g.
1. 20. 10 bibes, 1. 23. 5 veris adventus, 11. 2. 2 inimice, 111. 26. 7
arcus, lv. 2. 49 teque). And there are many places, too, where
interpolation may reasonably be suspected: such as 1. 31.
13-16‚ 111. 11. 17—20, and lv. 8 (either the whole or part).
In this matter it should be remembered that epigrams were
interpolated in Martial’s works in his own life-time (as he
himself complains, e.g. 1. 54, x. 100), and that Horace, being a
schoolbook, was especially liable to interpolation. A good
schoolrnaster, for instance, in commenting on Horace's style,
would doubtless compose a stanza now and again, to show the
trick of it, and some of these imitations, written in the margin
of the text, with other notes for lessons, might easily pass into
the text itself 1.

The question, however, whether a certain stanza is inter-
polated, or a certain reading is good enough for Horace, must
always remain open, unless some more authoritative MS. is
discovered. But the existing MSS. undoubtedly prove that the
text of Horace was, in very ancient times, doubtful, and was
emended by good scholars. A considerable number of our
