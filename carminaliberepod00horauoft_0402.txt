It appears therefore, that the ode was sung on the Palatine (at the
temple of Apollo) and on the Capitol: but as Jupiter and Juno are
nowhere expressly mentioned m the poem, Mommsen thinks the choir

(27 boys and 27 girls) sang in a procession from the Palatine to the
Capitol and back again.

The meaning of a saeculum was evidently a matter of high dispute-
Horace (no doubt accepting the decision of Augustus) defines it as 110
years (see 1. 21): Livy <quoted by Censorinus c.17) gave it as 100
years: the Emperor Claudius, thinking Augustus wrong, held the Ludi
again in Α. D. 47: and Domitian, disagreeing with Claudius, held them
in A.D. 88, when Tacitus himself was one of the XVviri (see Ann. XI.
11). Many further details are given in Smith's Dic't. of A ntiquities‚ 3rd
ed. s.v. Ludi Saeculares, but the column above mentioned was dis-
covered aster the date of the article.

Scheme. Phoebus and Diana, hear our prayers. O San, maintain
the pre-eminence of Rome. Ilithyia, protect our nursing mothers and
give long life to their offspring. Ye F ates. let our good fortune in the
future be equal to the past. Earth, grant us bounteous harvests.
Hear, O Apollo, the boys· Diana, hearken to the girls. If, byy our aid,
Aeneas came to Italy, prosper now our land with all goodnaes and
happiness, and grant the prayers now offered by Caesar, who has
vanquished every nation and restored every virtue Apollo hears and
answers: Diana inclines her ear to our entreaty. yea, all the gods
accord us their favour.

Many attempts have been made to apportion the stanzas between
the two choruses of boys and girls: but in this matter nothing can be
considered certain except that ll. 33, 34 were sung by the boys and 35,
36 by the girls. It would seem that Horace, when he wrote the ode,
was imperfectly acquainted with the order of proceedings, for, though
he mentions the Fates, Ilithyia and Tellus (i. e. the deities who were
worshipped at the nocturnal ceremonies)‚ he does not mention Jupiter
and Juno, to whom one day each was granted. (See also note to l.
14.) The last stanza seems to have been added as some compensation
for the omission. The last but one, also, seems to have been added at
a time when it was proposed that the processioa should go from the
Palatine to the Aventine (Diana's temple) and not from the Palatine to
the Capitol. If this be 50, we might imagine that the ode at first
contained 17 stanzas, of which the first 8 were sung by both choruses,
the 9th was divided and the last 8 again were sung by both.
