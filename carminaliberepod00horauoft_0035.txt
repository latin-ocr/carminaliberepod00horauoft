The original rhythms are said to be:

(α) J 0¹⁴! ,ΜΝ M JtM'! J σΓΙ J ἰ

(ὂ) Δ «ΓΙᾸἋΦΙ Δ.Ι ,ΜΕΝ ,ΕΙ ‚flwl ,Ι ,ΓΙ ,Ιη
(⁶) ΔΦΙΣέΔἿΙ 0¹ ,w η

(d) 0¹ ,ΡΙ ᾸῗέὲΙ .Ι J': ·

5. The Alcmanian stanza is used in ῐ. 7 and 28, and in
Epode 12. It consists of couplets made up of an ordinary
dactylic hexameter, followed by a dactylic tetrameter.

¹23· -πΙ--υ-ῦΙ-,ῦῦΙ-υὌΙ-υυΙ-·Ξ.

2,4. -ῦῦΙ-πΙ-ῦυ-Ι-Ξ.

In the second line, there is usually a caesura in the second

or third dactyl.
The rhythm is really dactylic, i.e. each dactyl is of the value

‘¹ Τ] and each spondee of the value οἱ ,Ι .

6. The other metres used in the Odes are exhibited only in
single specimens, which are treated in the notes as they sever-
ally occur (see 11. 18. 111. 12. 1v. 7). But the metre of 1. 4 may

be specially noticed here.
It is called the Fourth Α rclzz'lochz'an, and consists of a four-

line stanza in which the lines are arranged as follows ε
1, 3. —ffl—OE—, υ-ὐ-υυ, -υ-υ--.
2, 4· υ - υ - U, — ----- .
ne first line is called ‘the greater Archilochian’: the second

is an ‘ iambic trimeter catalectic ’1.
This combination is so curious that Dr Schmidt thinks that

Horace must have read the dactyls as ‘st J OF, not as
J JJ, so that the rhythm becomes trochaic‚ thus:

‚bjsslltffifflssffisslssffiJU NJ ,ww η
²24 NJNJJMJ'UJ'! A. Ι λη

¹ A ‘catalectic,’ or ⁴ stopping’ line, is one which comes to an end in
the middle os a soot.
