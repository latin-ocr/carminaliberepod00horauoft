332 ’ HORACE, ODES 1v. iv.

10. vividus. The repeated v (pronounced w) made this word a
good epithet of swishing or whistling motion: cs. vzvida vis perviczsst

venti vis verberat, fit via vi and other examples collected by Munro
Lucr. Introd. to Notes, Vol. 1131). 311.

13. pascuis, dat. with intenta.
14. ab ubere. No doubt, as Orelli says, lacte depulsum is one ’

notion= ‘ weaned,'ablactatum, ἀπογαλακτισθέντα. Then ab ubere- can be ⁴

appended: ‘just weaned from the teat of his tawny mother.' It
happens however that depellere a lacte, depellere ab ubere and depellere
alone are all used in Latin for ‘to wean' (Vergil Ecl. 3. 82: 7. 15:

Georg. 111. 187). For the tautology, cf. Prop. 1. 18. 15 et tua flendo ¹

Turpia deiectis lumina sint lacrimis and Ov. Met. 1. 683 euntem multa
loquendo detinuit sermone diem. It offends some editors here, who avoid
it either by taking ubere as adj. with lacte (‘rich milk’), or supposing
that fulvae m. ab ubere refers to the roe-decr, which also, like the lion, is
newly-weaned, or has wandered from its dam.

16. vidit, perfect, used of what often happens: cf. Roby ἐς 1478,
171137. videre, supply talem.
Raeti. See critical note.

18÷22. quibus—omnia. This curious prosy parenthesis can be
paralleled from Pindar and seems to be a deliberate imitation of him.
Some edd. think it an interpolation and omit it, reading et diu for sed
diu 111 1. 22. Orelli says that Horace 1s here seoffing at an absurd epic,
called Amazonis, by Domitius Marsus, a contemporary poet. More
probably it had been suggested to Horace that he might make a fine

Pindaric myth about the connexion of the Amazons with the Vindelici
but he found himself unequal to the seat.

2ο. Amazonia secun, called by Xenophon (Anab- 1V.4. 16)
σάγαρις and said to have been a single· edged axe.

21. quaerere distuli, cf. mitte sectari 1. 38. 2.

24. revictae, ‘conquered in their turn.'

rite. The three words rite, faustus and penetralia have religious
associations and imply that the Neros had been educated, as a Christian
might say, ‘ in God’s sight, ' or ‘ before the Lord. ’

mens, ‘intellect’. indoles, ‘.character’ >

28. Nerones. Suetonius (Ti.b 1.) says that Nero, in the Sabine
dialect, meant fortes ac strenuus.

29. fortibus et· bon-is, abl. cf. edite regz bus 1.1.1. Ι11 Latin the
combined epithetsfortis et bonus, like καλὸς ἔικάγαθόϊ 111 Greek, are osten
used to describe a thorough gentleman: cf. Epist. 1. 9. 13 et firtem
crede bonumque. (Observe the contrast of sortts to καλός.)

33. doctrina, very emphatic. ‘But it is training that brings out
the innate force.' Cf. Cic. pro Archia 15 cum ad naturameximiam
