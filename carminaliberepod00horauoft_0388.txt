344 HORACE, ODES 1v. viii, ix.

26. virtus with vatumz ‘the commanding force and favour and
eloquence of mighty poets,' cf. Cic. de Or. 11. 27. 120 oratoris vis illa
divina virtusque. (Some editors think the virtus is that of Aeacus,
but Horace has just said, in the previous ode, ll. 21—24‚ that nobody
can be saved from death by his own virtus.)

potentium, cf. ΙΙΙ. 3ο. 12 ex humili potens.

27. divitibus insulis (abl. loc.), ‘the islands of the blest,’ as in
Epod. 16. 42. These islands, the μακάρων νῆσοι, were supposed to lie
in the Atlantic, far to the West of the world. Homer intends the same
place by the name of the Elysian plain (Od. xv. 563). Hither favoured
heroes were translated, without dying. (In later mythology, the Elysian
fields were supposed to be a part of Hades, where the ghosts of the
pious were allowed to dwell.)

ffsssoemt' ‘)immortalizes’: cs. sacrare 1. 26. 11. (For the singular
ver c . 1. 3. 3.

28. In 1v. 9. 25-28 Horace says that many great men have failed
to obtain the notice of the Muse.

does not go quite so far as ovid who says (ex Ponto lv. 8. 55)
di quoque carminibus, si fas est dicere, fiunt, which means, in effect,
that there would be no gods if poets had not made them. ’

sic, i.e. by the good offices of the Muse.

comedy, who is always represented as a huge seeder (e.g. in the Birds
of Aristophanes). For epulis cf. 111. 3. 11, 12.

31. clusum sidus, in apposition with Tyndaridae, Castor and
Pollux. Cf. 1. 3. 2 n., 1. 12. 27.

33. ornatus—pampino. Almost the same words occur in 111. 25.
20, but there are many examples of such repetition in Horace (e.g. 1v.

by birth, his mother Semele being a mortal, cf. 111. 3. 13 n.

ode ΙΧ.

To Μ. Lollius, whose cognomen is unknown, though he was a very
distinguished man. He was consul B.c. 21 and though, in B.c. 16, he
suffered a heavy defeat from the Sygambri, Augustus does not seem to
have withdrawn his confidence from him. At any rate, he was appointed
in B.c. 2 special guardian and adviser to C. Caesar (son of Agrippa and
Julia and grandson to Augustus). Tiberius afterwards said that he
abused his trust (Tac. Ann. 111. 48) and both Pliny and Velleius give a
very bad account os him as a greedy and licentious hypocrite. The
eulogy which Horace bestows on him in this ode may have been
composed early in his career, but it must have required some courage
to publish it so soon after B.C. 16.
