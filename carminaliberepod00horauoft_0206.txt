162 HORACE, ODES 1. v, vi.

What slender youth, bedew'd with liquid odours,
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave,
Pyrrha? For whom bind'st thou
In wreaths thy golden hair,
Plain in thy neatness? O, how oft shall he
On saith and changed gods complain‚ and seas
Rough with black winds, and storms
Unwonted shall admire!
Who now enjoys thee credulous„ all gold,
Who always vacant, always amiable,
Hopes thee, of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they,
To whom thou untried seem‘st fair! Me, in my vow’d
Pictum, the sacred wall declares to have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern god of sea.

Ode Vl.
To M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the celebrated general and friend of

Augustus. (See note on l. 3.) He was consul three times (B.c. 37, 28, ’

27): married Aug. ’s daughter Julia in B.c. αι and died in 13 B.C. He
seems to have asked Horace to celebrate his exploits in an epic poem.

Schcme. Varius shall sing your feats of arms, Agrippa. Ι cannot
and dare not try to celebrate such glorious deeds. What lyrist is fit to
sing os the heroic figures of epic poetry ? Wine and love are the themes
of my muse. (For a similar treatment of a similar subject cf. 11. 12 and

lv, 2.
All-tre. The Fourth Asclepiad.

1. scriberis. A permissive future, like laudabunt alii in 1. 7. 1.
⁸ You can get Varius to write about you.' As a matter of fact, Varius
did write a Panegyricus Augusti, which must have contained much

about Agrippa.

vmo...alit1. The MS. reading alite is defended by Orelli as
abl. abs. (‘Varius being the bird of Maeonian song ')‚ but alite is too far
removed from Vario and the abl. abs. is not emphatic enough to contrast

Mtllhzgsaclgeiagon scribere ab Vario is not permissible, sor Hor. does not

use ab with the agent anywhere in the lyrics and very rarely elsewhere ·

(Sat. 1. 2. 11: 5. 92: 6. 88: 7. 22: Epist. 1. 1. 103: 12. 3: are the
only instances and some of these are doubtful).

Some editors regard alite as instrum. abl. used for abl. of the agent,
but no clear parallel can be cited. Vergil's uno graditur comitatus
Achate (Aen. 1. 312) is not similar, for the abl. is usual with comitatus,
even in prose. Other instances of abl. without ab (e.g. Epist. 1. 1. 94
curatus inaequali tonsore or Sat. 11. 1. 84 iudice laudatus Caesare) are

complicated by the presence of an adj. or noun in apposition‚ and are ·

usually regarded as abl. abs. (See Munro’s note in Mayor's Juvenal at
Ι. 13 assiduo ruptae lectore columnae.)
