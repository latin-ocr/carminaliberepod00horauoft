240 HoRACE, ODES 11. xiii, xiv.

epithet applied only to the dura fugae, because they involve disgrace.
It is much more natural to regard mala as the noun and dura as the
epithet. For navis and belli mala cf. 1. 32. 6, 7 and for fugae 11. 7.
10 n.

29. sacro, ‘religious,' a silence such as attends the ministrations
of the priest. Cf. 111. 1. 1-4.

34. belua centiceps, i.e. Cerberus, the watchdog of Hades. He
is usually represented with three heads only, but Horace had apparently
Pindar’s authority for giving him a hundred. Horace himself adopts
the other form in 11. 19. 31.

36. Eumenidum, dependent on capillis. Cf. Verg. Georg. lv. 482
caeruleos implexae crinibus angues Eumenides.

37. Prometheus. Horace alone assigns Prometheus to Tartarus

an expression parallel to fallere curam and fallere laborem ⁴ to beguile a

possible only if decipi is taken in middle or reflexive sense :decipere sibi
laborem. Cf. purgor bilem in Ars Poet. 302. For the sing. verb cf.
regat in 1. 3. 3, cogitet in 11. 11. 2 etc.

To one Postumus, of whom nothing is known and who is perhaps
an imaginary person. It is unlikely, however, that Horace would call
an imaginary person amice (l. 6) and it is possible that this is the same
Postumus to whom Propertius addressed an elegy (Ν. 12. 15) and who
seems to have gone to Asia with Augustus in ΒΩ. 20.
