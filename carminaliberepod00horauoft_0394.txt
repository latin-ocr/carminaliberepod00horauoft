13 cum zephyris et hirundine prima) and of the Thracian wind as very
violent (1. 25. 11, Epod. 13. 3).

3. prata—turgidi. Horace was never in the 'country at this time
of year and had forgotten what it looked like. Spring is just the time
when rivers are swollen.

6. lnfelix avis, the swallow. According to the mythology,
Procne, daughter of Pandion, king of Athens (hence Cecropiae domus)
and sister of Philomela, was married to Tereus, king of Thrace.
’ In revenge for an outrage done by him to her sister, Procne slew her
son Itys and served up his flesh to her husband. The rest of the story
is told in different ways, but Roman poets usually say that Procne was
changed into a swallow, Philomela into a nightingale (Verg. Georg. lv.

15, Ovid Met. vl. 412), while Greeks often call Philomela the swallow,
Procne the nightingale. ·

et. The addition of et is awkward, for aeternum opprobrium seems
to be nom. and properly in apposition to infelix avis. The only al-
ternative is to take opprobrium as accus. to gemens and refer ulta est to
Cecropia domus: ‘she mourns Itys and the reproach of Cecrops' house,
in that it cruelly punished’ etc. But to ascribe the crime, as well as
the reproach, to Cecrops’ house seems unwarranted.

For opprobrium cf. appr. pagi 11. 13. 4.
7. male with ulta est: ‘cruelly.'

baa-baras, the epithet belongs properly to regum (cf. Introd. p. xxiv):
‘outrages of barbarian kings.'

pinguium. The epithet is surprising‚ for obviously the sheep have
only lately been let out of the sold.

aig-rt: clothed in dark foliage: cf. 1. 21. 7.

ducere, ‘quaff’: Ι. 17. 22.

16. nardo—merebere. ‘ You shall earn your wine with spikenard.’

The guest was to bring nard in exchange for the wine: cf. 1. 31. 12
vina Syra reparata merce and 111. 19 (introductory note).

17. onyx, a box made of spar or alabaster. The contrast of the
little scent-box with the huge cadus is meant to be comic. Nard was·
