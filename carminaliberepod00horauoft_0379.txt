NOTES. 335

nibal’s speech, but a mild reflection of Horace himself, intended to
bring the ode to a quiet closer cf. 111. 3. 69-72.

75. cum sagaces. Some edd. think the allusion is to the sagacious
mre of Augustus, but the Netos deserved the compliment themselves
(see 1. ῃ). They had luck and they took pains.

76. - expediunt, ‘keep clear? free from entanglement: cf. 1. 27. 24
illigatum—Pegasus expediet.

doeth: cf. amara curarum in IV. 12. 19.

Ode V.

To Augustus, during his absence in Gaul (13.c. 16—13: cf. intro-
duction to the Second Ode).

Schem Retum, Augustus: thou hast been too long away. When
thou art here, the sun shines brighter, and as a mother yearnsfor her
’ sailor son, so all Italy yearns sor thee. To thee we owe security and
plenty and purity and peace. All our happiness is of thy giving.

¹3- votis—vocat, cf. Livy 1. 1 cum bonis potius ominibus votisque ³
