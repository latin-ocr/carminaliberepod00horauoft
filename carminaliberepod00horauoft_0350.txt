306 HORACE, oDEs 111. xxiii, xxiv.

thy hand when it was laid on the altar held no gift, it has sostened the
displeasure of the Penates with the pious offering of meal and crackling
salt, and could please no more with (i.e. if it brought) a costly vietim.'
This (with some differences as to sumptuosa hostia) is the accepted
versmn.

But why should manus mean ‘thy hand’? And how can a hand,
which brings meal and salt, be described as ‘bringing no gift' at all?
If immunis means sine munere (and it must), no doubt munus here
means ‘office‚' and immunis means ‘Enoffifllala’ privata, opposed to
the official pontifices. So Festus (quote by Paulus) says immunis
dicitur qui nullo fungitur qfficio, and Plautus T rin. 11. 2. 73 is est
immunis quoi nihil-est qui munus fungatur suum. Verg. Georg. 1v.
244 immunisque sedens aliena ad pabula fucus is not much different (see
Conington's note there).

- 18. sumptuosa hostia, possibly nominative, as Bentley took it.
‘ Is a lay hand (i.e. of a private person) touchoe the altar, a costly victim
does not appease the angered Penates more persuasively than a pious
gift of meal and crackling salt.' The objection, of course, is that the
final a of sumptuosa is not long, but the succeeding bl of blandior would
perhaps mask this irregularity.

Those editors (as Orelli and Wickham) who take sumptuosa hostia
as abl. consider manus nom. to mollivit and blandzbr=blandtbr futura,
translating as above (in note to l. 17). Or non sumptuosa might be
taken together: ‘more persuasive with an inexpensive offering’ (viZ.
farre pio etc.). For hostia used of an offering‚ not a vietim‚ cf. 1. 19.
14-16.

Dr Postgate reads the stanza as a question. This removes the diffi-

culty 'of the construction, but Hor. would hardly have meant a question
without giving some plain indication of it.

19. mollivit: ‘ever appeases‚’ an ‘aoristic perfect) or, as Roby
calls it (ἓ 1479), the perfect ‘ of repeated actions’: cf. 111. 3. 3² deseruit,
and explicuere in 111. 29. 16.

was offered, according to Pliny, by those who had no incense.

sallent-o, ‘ crackling ’ or ‘ sputtering ' in the fire.

ode χχιν.

Schema. The greatest wealth, the most impregnable building,
cannot ward off anxiety and death. Far better is the sirn le and pure
life of the nomad Scythians. Whosoever would win the name of
father of his country, must put a bridle on the licence of our times.
What is the use of complaints without punishments: what of laws
without a higher morality? The canker of greed and luxury must be
cut out, and the minds of the young trained to more manly-ideals.
