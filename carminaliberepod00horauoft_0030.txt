xxvi INTRODUCTION.

In Horaee’s Odes, we know the metreS, but we do not know
the rhythms. , In other words we do not know how Horace
himself would have read and scanned his lines. For instance,
’ the First Ode of the First Book consists of lines of this metre:

--------- -υῦ, But the lines may be scanned and
read in several different ways: thus

(1) Maece Ι nas ata Ι vis Ι edite Ι regi Ι bus.
(2) Maece Ι nais atavis Ι edite reg Ι ib1'1s.

(3) Maece Ι nas ata Ι vis Ι edite Ι regibus.
(4) Maecenas at Ι avis edi Ι te regibus.

Of these methods, the first represents the original Greek‘
rhythm ε the second, the scansion which was adopted by gram-
marians nearly contemporary with Horace: the third, a possible
scansion which occurs naturally to an English reader: the
fourth is an old-fashioned method which is seldom mentioned
now, but which has some merits.

That Horace usually employed the second method‚ is ren-
dered probable by such lines as

exegi monumentum aere perennius (111. 30. 1)
or perrupit Acheronta Herculeus labor (1. 3. 36):

still more by such a line as

dum flagrantia detorquet ad oscula (11. 12. 2 5).
These instances suggest that there was not such a pause on
the sixth syllable as is required by the first method or the third.

But it would seem that, in this matter of ‘pause,’ Horace
was not likely to be consistent. Witness his treatment of
synapkeia.

Synapheia is the ‘connexion’ of line with line, so that
(among other effects) a syllable liable to elision may not con-
clude a line if the next line begins with a vowel. Horace, as a
rule, follows the Greek lyrists in maintaining synapheia, and
several times elides a concluding syllable before a vowel at the
beginning of the next line, or divides a word between two lines.
See, for elision, 11. 2. 11 : 3. 27: 16. 34: 111. 29. 35: 1v. 1. 35:
2. 22 and 23: Carm. Saec. 47: and, for division, 1. 2. 19: 25. 11:
