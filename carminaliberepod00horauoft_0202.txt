158 HORACE, ODES 1. iii, iv. ’

16. tollere. The first seu is omitted, as in Sat. 11. 8. 16 Albanum,
Maecenas, sive Falernum Τ e magis appositis delectat, habemus utrumque.

ponere, ‘to lull!

1 7. gradum, ‘ stride? The word is often used of a fighting attitude,
e.g. inque gradu stetimus, certi non cedere, Ov. Metam. lx. 43.

18. siccis, ‘ tearless.' The ancient Greeks, as every reader of
Homer knows, wept freely from sear or other emotions. The impassive
behaviour of the modern Englishman seems to have been only gradually

acquired. ⁶ See the description of the scene which preceded the murder
of Becket m Stanley’s Memorzals qf Canterbury, p. 56.

20. Acroceraunia. (now Cape Glossa), a cliff on the coast of EpiruS,
infamis for shipwrecks.

22. prudens emphatic, as in 111. 29. 29.

mssoctabffl with active sense, ‘estranging’ (as Matt. Amold ‘the
unplumb’d salt estranging sea'): but Statius in his imitation (Silvae
111. 2. 61) speaks of the sea as rude et abscissum miseris animantibus,
from which it may be inferred that he took dissoc. here in the passive
sense as ‘estranged.’ Adjs. in -bilis are not. often active in Hor„ but he
has illacrymabilis ‘unable to weep' in 11. 14. 6 and flebilis ‘weeping'
in IV. 2. 21. penetrabile fngus in Verg. Georg. 1. 93 and genitabiltk
aura Favoni in Lucretius 1. 1 1 are good specimens.

¹ 25. audax...perpet1, cf. lntrod. p. xxiii.

26. gene humana. The audacious ingenuity of man is the theme
of one os the most famous passages of Sophocles (Antig. 333 sqq.).

27. audax. For the repetition cf. 1. 2. 4, 5 and 21, 23.
Iapeti genua. Prometheus son of Iapetus.

28. flando mala, ‘an unhappy thest' (Wickham).

30. mactes, ‘wasting sickness.’

31. incubuit, ‘attacked‚’ cf. Lucr. V1. 1141 morbifer aestus· Incu-
buit populo Pandionis.

32. prius with semoti.

necessitas with leti ‘doom of death.’ In the golden age (as
described by Hesiod Works and Days 90 sqq.) men lived untroubled by
disease and died as if falling asleep. Conington translates ‘and slow

{ate quicken‘d Death’s once halting pace‚' separating necessitas from
etz.

34. expertus for expertus est.

36. perrupit Acheronta. The final -it is lengthened by the rhyth-
mical accent or stress, commonly (but erroneously) called arsis. (The
word arsis ‘raising' originally meant ‘ lifting the foot ’ and so ‘removing
the stress,’ not ‘raising the voice.‘) Other examples are 11. 6. ¹4
angulus ridet ubi: 11. 13. 16 timet aliunde and 111. 16. 26 quicquid
arat impiger.

Herculeus labor, ‘the labour of Hercules,’ cf. Herculea manu in

11. 12. 6 and Giganteo triumpho in 111. 1. 7 (where Giganteo represents
an objective genitive). See Roby L. G. ἕ 1277.
