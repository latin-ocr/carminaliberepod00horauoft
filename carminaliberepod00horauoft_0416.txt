372 HORACE, EPODE v.

Subura, a low street of Rome, tried to recover the love of an old dandy
named Varus. For this purpose, she has kidnapped a boy and proceeds
to murder him, with the assistance of her friends Sagana, Veia and
Folia. The boy screarns in terror (ll. 1—14), but the witches go on
with their preparations (15-46). It is dark now and Canidia begins
her incantation (47-60). There is no result. She will try a stronger
enchantment (61-82). The boy, seeing his fate, curses the whole
· crew 8 —102).

It (wis certainly believed that children were murdered for purposes
of the black arts. For instance, Cicero (in Vatin. 6. 14) charges
Vatinius to his face that he was wont puerorum extis deos manis
mactare, and Orelli quotes an inscription from the tombstone of a boy so
murdered. The same charge has been frequently brought against Jews
from the time of William of Norwich (who disappeared ΑΛ). 1144)
down to the present day. ·

Canidia is said to have been one Gratidia‚ a Neapolitan seller of
unguents. Epode 17 and Sat. 1. 8 are devoted to her, and she is
mentioned several times elsewhere (Epod. 3. 8: Sat. 11. 1. 48, 8. 95).
Some edd. think that Carm. 1. 16 is a recantation addressed to her.

For other descriptions of witches and their incantations see Theocr-
Idyll. 2, Verg. Ecl. 8. 64 sqq„ Ovid Met. vn. 180 sqq.

Canidia, who falsely pretended to be a mother (see 17. 50).

7. purpurae, the border of his toga praetexta. It is called inane
decus because it should have protected him. Quintilian (Decl. 340)
speaks of sacrum illud praetextarum quo sacerdotes velantur, quo magis-
tratm, quo infirmitatem puerorum sacram facimus et venerabilem.
