INTRODUCTION. xxv

ἡ (b) Similarly, a verb, which belongs to both parts of a
compound sentence, is often inserted in the second part with
·que or -vez e.g. 1. 30. 6 Gratiae properentque nymphae: 11. 7.
24 apio curatve myrto. Also 11. 17. 16: 19. 28, 31: 111. 4. 12:
Carm. Sacc. 22.

(c) Sentences·in which a word may be constructed with
either of two other words—the 'so-called construction ἀπὸ κοινοῦ
οι· ‘in common’--are frequent. A striking instance is in 11. 18.
37 hic levare sunctum Ι pauperem laboribus Ι vocatus atque non
vocatus audit. Here laboribus is appropriate to levare and to
sunctum: and levare is appropriate to vocatus and to audit.
So in 11. 11. 11 consiliis· may be constructed with minorem and
fatigas: and in 111. 8. 19 sibi with infestus or dissidet.

'rbat the Romans found something inimitable in Horace’s
style is evident from the rarity and badness of the attempts to
imitate him. The few pieces of sapphics and alcaics in Statius
and Ausonius are almost doggrel.

5 5. Metres of tlte Odes.

The first eleven odes of the Ist Book comprise examples of
nearly all the metres used by Horace in the Odes. The only
novelties introduced in later books are the Hipponactie stanza
of 11. 18, the Archilochian of IV. 7 and the Ionic of 111. 12.

Metre, in Latin and Greek, is the arrangement of long and
short syllables in a line of poetry.

Rhythm is the arrangement of stresses (ictus) or loud
syllables, In other words, metre is the mode of constructing
a line: rhythm is the mode os reading or singing it ¹.

For purposes os mette, all long syllables are alike‚ and all
short syllables are alike: but sor purposes of rhythm (as in

music) long syllables may be of different lengths‚ and short
syllables may be of different lengths.

¹ In English mette and rhythm are identical, for with us a syllable
which has stress is long, and a syllable which has no stress is short.
