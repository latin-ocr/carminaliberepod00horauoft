1. nox erat. This introduction recalls both the occasion on which
Neaera vowed fidelity, and some of the deities by whom she swore.

taciturna noctis Stgna ‚cum caclo.

α. minora sidera, cf. C. 1. 12. 47 inter tgnes Luna minores.

7. pecori lupus, sc. infistus esset, the verb being supplied from

Tibullus 1. 4. 57 solis aeterna est Phoebo Bacchoque iuventus, Nam decet

15. offensi. Those edd. who read effusae translate ‘nor will my
resolution yield to beauty which has once become odious to me ’
(Wickham): but if the beauty is odious, why should he yield to it?
Offimi, which seems to have been read by Acron (Introd. p. xxxvi), gives
better sense and is more in accordance with Hor-’s usage. For semel,
‘once and finally,’ cf. C. 111. 5. ²9· For offensi ef. below 17. 42, Sat. 11.
1. 67. constantia is ⁸ my resolution in being angry.'
