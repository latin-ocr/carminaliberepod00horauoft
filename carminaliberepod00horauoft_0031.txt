INTRODUCTION. xxvii

other places, synapheia‘ is ignored and hiatus permitted. HiatuS,
of course, implies a slight pause, while synapheia implies that
there was no pause between two lines.

For reasons such as these, it is impossible to put forward
an authoritative scansion to Horace's lines. In the metrical
schemes here subjoined no scansion will be suggested, but the
original (i.e. the Greek) rhythm will be given in musical nota-
tion according to the theories of Dr J. H. H. Schmidt ¹. It will
be seen that Dr Schmidt divides a line into bars of equal
length, i.e. occupying the same time in delivery.

In the metr-tta! sckemes, a comma marks the caesura or
diaerem, i.e. the point which must coincide with the end of a
word'.

1t remains to be added that all the odes of Horace seem to
be divisible into stanzas of four lines. The only exceptions are
1v. 8, which there are many reasons for rejecting in whole or in
part: and 111. 12, which consists of four periods of ten feet each.
The meti-es were undoubtedly borrowed by Horace from the
Greek lyrists, especially Alcaeus, but he has introduced many
small alterations, such as the use of long syllables where the
Greeks allowed shortS‚ and the regular use of caesura where the
Greeks had none.

1. ΤῙιε Aleuae stanza is used in 37 odes, viz.=

1. 9. 16. 17. 26. 27. 29. 31. 34. 35. 37.
11. 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. 13. 14. 15. 17. 19. 20.

² Technically, caesura is the division of a foot between two words,
so that part os the foot belongs to one word, the remainder to another.
Distentis, on the other hand, is the division of feet from one another so
that one soot ends with a word, while the next begins a new word.
Thus, in the bucolic hexameter, there is caesura in the third soot and
diaeresis between the fourth and fifth : as

Nos patri Ι ae fi Ι nes et Ι dulcia Ι linquimus Ι arva.
