(11)le me, ‘were 1 rich.' scilicet, ‘that is to say’ (a very unusual
sense .

mlum, ‘works of art': cf. Epist. 1. 6. 17 aeraque et artes Suspice,
and Aeneid v. 359 clypeum—Didymaonis artes.

6. Parrhasius. An Ephesian painter who lived at Athens about
B.C. 410. He was the rival of Zeuxis.

Scopas of Paros, a celebrated sculptor who flourished about B.c.
380—350. Many of his works were in Rome, e-g. the statue of Apollo
which Augustus set up in his great Palatine temple. The famous statue
of Demeter seated, now in the British Museum, is attributed to him or
his younger contemporary Praxiteles.

7. nqutdts, in contrast with saxo,

Τὴθ reference is to the titulus inscribed on a statue, recording the
exploits of the person portrayed: cf. Ovid Trist. 111. 3. 72 quosque

no ts.

¹4· bonis ducibus. The epithet is utterly prosaie. (Contrast the
genuine dux bone of lv, 5. 5 and 37.) The addition of post mortem,
