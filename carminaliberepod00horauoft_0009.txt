PREFACE.·

HIS edition of Horace’s Odes and Epodes was under-
taken at the request of the Syndics of the Pitt Press.

In the text, at a few notorious passages, I have admitted

conjectures which give a good sense with very little altera-

tion of the letters. The spelling is, for obvious reasons,

adapted in the main to that of Lewis and Short's lexicon.
In regard to, final -es and -is in acc. plur. of the 3rd deelen·
sion I have almost always followed the indications given in
Keller's Epilegomena.

In preparing the noteS, I have used Orelli‘s edition (as
revised in 1885 by Hirschfelder) freely for illustrative quo-
tations. It is the common quarry. Besides this, I have
referred very often to the editions of A. Kiessling (1884)
and Dean Wickham (1874), less frequently to those of
Mr' Page'(1886)‚ C. W. Nauck (1880) and· H. Schiitz (1874).
Τὴε dates given are the dates of my copies.

I am greatly indebted to my friend Dr Postgate, of
Trinity College‚ for many corrections and suggestions,

The notes contain, here and there, reminiscences of the

teaching of Prof. J. W. Hales, formerly F ellow of Christ’s
College.
