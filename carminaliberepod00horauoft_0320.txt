unde...1nscius‚ ⁶ not knowing whence he was to win life.’

sumeret is the oblique form of what, in direct speech, would be a
dubitative question, unde vitam sumam? (Roby L. G. 1610, 1612).
Cf. Caesar B. G. 111. 14 Non satis Bruto vel tribunis militum constabat
quid agerent aut quam rationem pugnae insisterent.

38. pacem duello miscuit, ‘has mingled peace with war‚' or
perhaps ‘ has confused peace with war.' In either case, the point is the
same. We admire soldiers, as Ruskin says (in ‘ Unto this Last'),
because it is their trade to be killed. The soldier who, in war, asks
unde vitam sumam, is not a warrior at all.

duello, the old er form which afterwards became bello, as duis became
bis and duonus bonus. A somewhat similar change is seen in English
Bill compared with William.

38. ο pudor, the dishonour to Rome.

40. altior, ‘ made taller,' ‘raised higher by the shameful ruins of
Italy.' Carthage is imagined as standing on the ruins of Italy.

of the citizenship.' Regulus lost his citizenship and therefore his rights
as pater familias, when he was taken prisoner 3 for capite deminutus est

qui in hostium potestatem venit (quoted from Festus by the lawyer 1¹

Paulus). For the gen. capitis see Roby L. G. ἓξ 1320, 1321.
44. torvus, ‘sullen,’ ‘gloomy.’
humi posuisse=dqfixirse in terram.

45. donec firmaret...properaret. ⁴ While he was bracing...and
while he was hurrying away.' donec in this sense usually has the ’Ϊ
indicative, as 1. 9. 17, 111. 9. 1, 5: but here the clause is in oratio obl. ,

dependent on fertur.

46. auctor. The auctor of a senatus consultum was the senator ¹

nunquam anas, more emphatic than non alias: ⁴ never given before ⁴

50. tortor. It is said that Regulus’ eyelids were drawn wide apart ff·
