Ode ΙΙ.

To C. Iullus Antonius, second son of M. Antonius the triumvir by
Fulvia. He was educated by his stepmother Octavia, whose daughter
Marcella he married. He was consul Β. c. 10 and was in high favour

only complete compositions of his that we have are a series of choral
odes (ἐπινίκια) in praise of victors in the Greek athletic contests.
Besides these, however, he wrote hymns to the g,ods odes for
processions (προσόδια), songs os maidens (repedarent),g dancing- -songs
(ὑπορχήματα), drinking· songs (σκολιά), dirges (θρῆνοι) and encomia on
princes. The following stanzas contain allusions to most of these styles
of composition.

2. Iullo. This spelling is attested by inscriptions, e.g. C. I. L.

Tullus to Tullius.

ceratia, ‘fastened with wax.’ The myth related that Daedalus
made wings for his son Icarus and fastened them to his shoulders with
wax, but that the youth soared so near the sun that the wax melted and
he fell headlong into the Icarian sea. Cf. 1. 3. 34.

l b ope Daegalea, ‘by help of Daedalus.’ For the adj. cf. Herculeus
a or Ι. 3. 3 .

3. mum, cf. Aeneid 1v. 252 paribus nitens Cyllenius alis.
4. nomina, sor the plural cf. 111. 27. 76.

ponto, i. e. the Icarian sea, the eastern part of the Aegaean. It was
