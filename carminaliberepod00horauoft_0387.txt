NOTES. 343

Cortes discovered the Pacific‚ and Spenser confused Lionel Duke of
Clarence (son of Edward ΙΙΙ.) with George (brother of Edward 1V.).
But the conquest of Carthage was as important in Roman history as the
conquest of the Armada in English history and it is inconceivable that
Horace made a mistake about it or that the mistake, being made, was
not pointed oqt to him and corrected.

18. eius. ΤΙιε pronoun is is rarely used by Augustan poets at all
and does not occur elsewhere in the odes except in 111. 1 1. 18, a passage
otherwise suspicions. illius would be used here even in prose.

19. mmm again is a rare and somewhat vulgar word, generally
having the sense of ‘pocketing.' Its use here is quite unparalleled.
For the sense cf. Sat. 11. 1. 65 Laelius aut qui Duxit ab oppressa
metitum Carthagine nomen.

20. calam Pierides. The allusion is to the Muse of Ennius,
who was a native of Rudiae in Calabria and wrote, in his Annales,
a poetieal account οξ the Second Punicf WarMolgxilitt gigrggriltliff'ffisssz 1οξ

21. ⁸1 chartae sileant. chartae are properly sheets of papyrus.
The word is osten used for the ‘writings,' as we might say the ‘pages,’
os an author (cf. lv, 9. 30). But chartae, sor ‘books' in general, is a
rare and apparently contemptuous expression (cf. Epist. 11. 1. 35). The
verb sileant is also remarkable, for it is an exceptional compliment,
worthy of an exceptional metaphor‚ when we say of a page that ‘it
speaks! Thus Catullus (valn. 46) specially begs the Muses facite
haec charta loquatur anus. With silere we expect a personal nominative,
as in lv. 9. 30 non ego te meis Chartis inornatum silebo.

Μ. mae naver-usque puer. The mention of both parents is
unusual (cf. lv. 6. 37), but Wickham sees some point in it ( ‘despite his
royal and divine ancestry'). The legend that Ilia, daughter of Aeneas
(not Rhea sylvia), was mother of Romulus is followed in 1. 2. 17. It
seems to have been os Greek origin and was certainly popularised by
Naevius and Ennius.

²3. mmmm is an odd personification of Silence, cf. lividas
obliviones in ιν. 9. 3²·

the way of the services os Romulus’ (i.e. prevented them from reaching
our ears). This might pass, but the addition of Romuli (after the'
already redundant Iliae Mavortisque puer) is most suspicious.

25. Aeacum. Perhaps a mistake sor Rhadamanthus, who, in
Homeric mythology, ruled the isles os the blest (οᾱ. rv. 564). Every-
where else (e.g. 11. ¹3· υ, Ovid Met. xm. 2 5) Aeacus is represented as
one os the judges of Hades, sar removed from the islands of the blest.
lt is true that, by omitting the line, we deprive consecrat of an ac-
cusative: but beat, just belovv, is also without an accusative. ,
