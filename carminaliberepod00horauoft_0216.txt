172 HORACE, ODES 1. xii.

15. mundum, ‘the heavens‚’ cs. Verg. Georg. 1. 5 vos ov clarissima
mundi lumina.

16. herisi, ‘seasons,’ like the Greek ὧραι.

17. unde=a quo, cf. 1. 28. 28: 11. 12. 7 telluris iuvenes unde. A
‚ similar use of hinc in 111. 17. 2.

18. seeundum (fr. sequor)=‘ following close.’ Thus secundus
ventus is ‘ the wind that follows fast.'

19. proximos, ‘next' but not near: as in Verg. Aen. V. 320
proximus huic, longo sed proximus intervallo.

20. Pal-las, identified by Romans with Minerva. Pallas, with the
Greeks, was a decidedly bellicose divinity. Aeschylus (Septem 119)
calls her φιλόμαχον κράτος. Vergil calls her (Aen. XI. 483) armipotens.

22. v1rgo, Diana ‘queen and huntress,’ as Ben Jonson calls her.

25. Alciden, Heracles (Hercules) was the son of Alcmena and
grandson of Alceus.

puerosque Ledae. Castor and Pollux were the two sons, Helen
and Clytaemnestra the two daughters of Leda. Puer is osten used by
Horace of divine offspring: as 1. 19· 2, 111. 12. 4.

26. Κάστορά θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πὺξ ἀγαθὸν Πολυδεύκεα Iliad 111. 237,
cf. Hor. Sat. 11. 1. 26 Castor gaudet equis, ovo prognatus eodem Pugnis.

superare nobilem, cf. Introd. p. xxiii.

27. quorum alba...stella‚ cf. 1. 3. an. For alba ‘clearing‚’ see
1. 7. 15 n.

31. ponto. Orelli regards this as dative (cf. Introd. p. xxiv).

33—36. The point of the stanza seems· to be: .‘ Who is most god-
ἰὶίἒεεεέήᾶξεὲῐῖιιὲἓῐεοὶἷιη liiiss. ἓνὲζῗίἱ ἓξ Numa 111 his law-g1v1ng or Tarquin in

33. quietum...rog·num. Numa Pompilius, the peaceful‚ was re·
garded as the founder of Roman religious observances.

34. memorem. The construction is: dubito (utrum) memorem
Romulum an q. P. r. etc.

superbos...fasces. Tarquinius Priscus is said to have introduced
the fasces from Etruria. sup. Tarq. fasces is a hypallage for fasces
Tarquini superbi. It is possible that Horace was here thinking not so
much of Tarquin as of Brutus, who expelled him.

35. catoms. M. Porcius Cato, the younger, committed suicide at
Utica aster the battle of Thapsus (B.c. 46) had given the final over-
throw 1ο the senatorial or republican party. His death was regarded

as heroic by all good conservatives‚ cf. 11. 1. 24 cuncta terrarum subacta
Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

See, however, the critical note.

3.7—-44. The great names of these stanzas are not given in chrono-
logical order. M. Atilius Regulus was killed at Carthage B.c. 2502
