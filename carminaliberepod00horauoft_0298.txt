applied literally to the river, but metaphorically to the sea. ‘Thou
bendest to thy sway.’

18. uvidus, ‘steeped in wine ἐ cf. 1. 7. 22 and 1. 18. 3.

19· nodo viperino, ‘ a knot of snakes) The Maenads in Euripides
(Bacchae 104 and 696) wear live snakes in their hair and about their
waists. For snakes in connexion with Bacchus cf. 1. 18. 11 n.

20. Bistonidum crinin. The Bistonides are the women of the
tribe of Bistones, a Thracian people who were enthusiastic in the
worship of Bacchus. Cf. 1. 36. 14 and 11. 7. 27 for allusions to
Thracian orgies.

sine fraude, ‘ without hurt’ to the women. Cf. Carm. Saec. 41.
22. Gigantum. Cf. 11. 12. 7 and 9, and 111. 4. 49—63. ’

2 3. Rhoetum. The giant slain by Bacchus is elsewhere called
Eurytus, whereas Rhoetus was a Centaur who fought with the Lapithae
(Verg. Georg. 11. 456). Horace however names Rhoetus among the
giants again in 111. 4. 55. The legend that Bacchus changed himself
into a lion is not found elsewhere.

2 5. quamquam, ‘ and yet,’ Gr. καίτοι.

27. idem. ‘Thou wast the same in the midst of peace and of
war.' For the position of -que cf. 1. 32 and 1. 30. 6: also curatve in
11. 7. 25. The meaning apparently is that Bacchus was always the
leader, whether of the danee or the combat.

It is to be observed that, as wine makes some men quarrelsome,
others merry, the worship of Bacchus was introduced into Greece in two
forms, a savage and brutal form which came by way of Thrace, and
a mild and cheerful form which came from the South. Both forms
existed together in Attica. The legends concerning the god, similarly,
represent him now as kind and beneficent, now as cruel and blood-
thirsty. The late Mr Pater, writing on the Bacchae of Euripides, says
“Dionysus Omophagus, the eater of raw flesh, must be added to the
golden image of Dionysus Meilichius, the honey-sweet,” if we are to
form a clear idea of the place of the god in Greek religion. See also
L. Dyer’s Τ he Gods in Greece, pp. 75—117.

29. te vidit, sc. aggredientem, as recedentzls· in 31 implies. Bacchus

aureo cornu decorum. Bacchus carried to Hades a golden drinking·
