226 Holmon, ODES 11. vi, vii.

about B.C. 708 (after the first Messenian war). Hence Lacedaemonium
Tarentum in 111. 5. 56.
Horace again expresses his affection for Tibur and Tarentum in

Epist. 1. 7. 44 mihi non tam regia Roma Quam vacuum Tibur placet
aut imbelle Tarentum.

13. terrarum, with angulus, ‘nook.'

14. Hymetto. Hymettus is here put for ‘honey of Hymettus' as
in 16 Venafro for ‘olives of Venafrum.’ This is the figure called
comparatio compendiaria, or abbreviated comparison‚ of which κόμαι
Χαρίτεσσιν ὁμοῖαι ‘hair like the Graces' (Iliad XVII. 51) is the stock
example. There is another in 11. 14. 28.

ridet. For the long final syllable, cf. 1. 3. 26.

15. decedunt, ⁴ give way to.' Cf. the similar use of adsurgere (with
dat. ‘to rise and make room for') in Verg. Georg. 11. 98.

16. baca, ‘the olive‚' the noblest of berries.

Venafrum on the Via Latina, in the north of Campania. (viridi
because of its olive-groves.)

Cf Venafro is t(liat. as certantem et uvam purpurae in Epode 2. 20 shows.
. 1. 1. 15 an 3. 13.

18. brumas. bruma is said to be a contraction of brevz‘ma (shortest
day) an old superlative of brevis. Cf. primus, summus.

Aulon, a mountain in Calabria near Tarentum. This is an inversion
of the same comparatio compendiaria that we saw in Hymetto l. 14, for
Aulon means ‘the grapes of Aulon.’

¹9· Baccho, dat. after amicus. Bacchus is called firtilzln because
he makes the vines fertile. Cf. varius Autumnus 11. 5. ια n.

20. invidet, ‘looks with envy on.’

21. beatae, ‘ favoured' with wealth and prosperity.
The emphasis on ille and beatae is important. Horace prefers that
place and a comfortable stronghold to the wild fastnesses of Spain.

22. arces. Tarentum itself is situated on a roeky island. Its
towering appearance is noticed by Verg. Georg. lv. 125 sub Oebaliae
turribus arcis (al. altzk).

tbi, emphatic, there and not in Spain.

23. sparges. This picture of Septimius weeping as he collects in
an urn the warm ashes, all that remain of his deceased friend, is rather
comic than pathetic. Probably Septimius, in offering to accompany
Horace to Spain, had pointed out the advantage it would be to Horace
to have a friend at hand in case of fatal accidents. Horace accepts his
kind offer of assistance but appoints the funeral at Tarentum, not among
the sav es, ἰ

Ηοΐὲεε had no superstitious dread of death. In his view, it was
the end of pleasures and it was bound to come, and that was all that
was worth saying about it. (See 1. 4. 11 ; 11. 9. 14. ¹8.) He wanted
merely to live and die comfortably.
