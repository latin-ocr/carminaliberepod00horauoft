14. Min. sacra mentito, ‘that seigned Minerva’s worship ’ (Wick-
ham). The wooden horse, by means of which Troy was taken, was

represented to be a gift to Pallas in place of the stolen Palladium : cf.
Aeneid Π. 17 and 183.

. male feriatos, ‘making untimely holiday.'

16. falleret = fefellisset, as ureret in l. 19 = ussisset, the protasis being
ni...pater adnuisset of 1. 22, which means, in effect, ‘ if Achilles had lived
to capture Troy.'

The imperfect subj. suggests the indic. ille non fallebat...sed urebat
(Roby L. G. ξ 1470), with the sense ‘He would not have been for
stealing unawares on the Trojans...but would have been for buming’ etc.

aulam, ‘the court? for ‘the courtiers.‘

17. palam captis, ‘taken in open fight.’ These words, so em-
phatically placed, convey the real antithesis to non falleret as much as
if Hor. had written sed palam caperet et gravis ureret etc. For palam
ef. Cic. Or. 12. 38 non ex insidiis sed aperte ac palam. gravia, ‘pitiless.’

21. ni. This form is used by Horace in lyrics only here and in
Epod. 1. 8. ni=si non, cf. 11. 17. 28.

22. divum, gen. plur. This form also is used by Horace only here
and perhaps in 1. 2. 25 (where it may be accus. sing). Lucian Muller
thinks the whole stanza an interpolation, partly because of these oddities
of expression and partly because the reason here implied for the death
of Achilles (viz. Apollo’s wish to save Aeneas), seems inconsistent with
that given in the first stanza.

ἐξ. ·rebus Aeneae, ‘the fortunes of Aeneas': cf. Aeneid vul. 471
res rotae.

potiore ante, ‘with a better omen’: cf. 1. 15. 5 mala avi.
ductos, ‘traced,’ cf. Aeneid 1. 423 pars ducere muros.
25. argutae, ‘clear-voiced,' λιγείας, asin 111. 14. 21.

26. Xantho, not the Trojan river (also called Scamander), but a
river of Lycia near Patara, where Apollo had a famous shrine (cf. 111.
26. 10). A similar turn is given to a description of Apollo in 111. 4. 61
qui rore puro Castaliae lavit Crinis solutos. The long hair of the god,
like his beardless chin (levis, l. 28), is a sign of - perpetual youth.
