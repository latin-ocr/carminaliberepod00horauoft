Ode ΙΙ.

‘ro C. Sallustius (or Salustius) Crispus, the great-nephew and
ndo ‘ve son of Sallust the histor-ian. Like Maecenas, he declined
and office, but was nevertheless a very powersul personage and
enjoyed a close intimacy with Augustus. He died at a great age in
Am. ao. He was very rich and generous.

Sthene- Money‚ as you know, Sallust, was made to be used, not
lan-ied- The generosity of Proculeius wins him undying fame. Con-
quer avarioe and your sway will be wider than many provinces. Give
in to it and it will grow worse and worse. Happiness belongs not to

⁶ but to him who is indifferent to riches-
ode re resents that small portion of Stoicism which Horace
combined withhis Epicureanism. On the date, see 1. 17.

1-4. The meaning of the text as it stan'ds is: ‘There is no

' men in silver when buried in the hoarding earth, (as ‚you know)
nst, who hate 211 bullion unless it shines with moderate use.' But
the bngffie is obscure and weak too, sor nisi is wholly dependent on
mistice the point os the stanza, which lies in nisi...splendeat usu,
is not delivered by Horace himself but put as an opinion of Sallustius.
Pmc. Houmn's ‘on minimusque gives much better sense: ‘ Silver
hu no lunxe ruffi in the hoarding earth (i. e. the mine) and very
time when melma, unless it shines with moderate use! (Prof. Housman’s
other conjecture minuique involves a doubtful use of minuit and is less
tvm.. If inimice is read in l. α, then argento stands for money
μά πανὺ terris is a kind of hypallage sor ‘under-ground heard! But
15 minimusque is read in 1. 2, then argento stands for ‘silver ore' and
the earth is mned avara in the sense of ⁴ hard-gripping,’ or ‘ capacious ⁹
(d. aun nari in 111. ²9· 61). This latter sense is the more probable
beeeuoe Horace seems to be translating a Greek proverb οὐκ ἔστ’ ἐν

dnm amnon, ὅ ξέν’, ἄργυρος (Plut. devit. pud. 111. p. 148). Cf. also
111. 3. ⁴9 cumn arepertum etc.

p. Uib. Again, if abdito means ‘put away,’ then terris may be
dum (d. hurtaudi! ensem in Aeneid 11. 553). But if abdito means
nuely ‘maculem' terris is ablat.

m ( ρειαί from laminas cs. puertiae in 1. 36. 8) means
[ζωροῦ] ι · 'n plate' of metal but obviously refers here to worked
niver, whether u mgotz or plate or coin.

5. 'mamm C. Proculeius Varro Murena was brother to
Terentio, Maecenu' wife. and to L. Licinius Murena (addressed in
11. 1ο. 1). Porphyrion (Introd. p. xxxvi) says he had another brother

called Sci ⁰ 0 (perheps we should read C io and that, when his brothers
had loet r all nn the civil war, he diega? his property with them.
