NoTEs. 32 1

Ode XXX.

The Epilogue. ‘I have raised a monument imperishable. While
Rome stands, my-name shall be known as the first of Italy’s lyrists.
Give me, Melpomene, the crown that I have won.'

Metre. First Asclepiad (employed also in 1. 1).
6 1. exegi, ‘I have finished’; cf. liis demum exactis in Aeneid vl.
37m, sor bronze statues.

τ. regau situ, ‘the royal pile.’ Literally, situs here means ‘ mode
of construction? but the abstract is used for the concrete, as in Prop. 111.
α. 19 pyramidum sumptus ad sidera ducti. Kiessling takes the word
here as=‘mouldering dust‚' but altius is incongruous with this.

3. impotens, i. e. sui impotens, ἀκρατής, ‘unable to control itself,'
‘fiantic,’ cf. 1. 37. ιο.

5. fuga. temporum=tempus fugax, cf. 11. 14. 1.

7. Libitinam. Venus Libitina was the old Italian goddess of death,
identified afterwards with Proserpine. Attached to her temple was a
store of biers and other requisites for funerals. Hence Libitina some-
times means ‘burial' and some edd. so take it here, to avoid a tautology
with non omnis mon'ar. Most readers will prefer the tautology.

unque, with crescam. ‘I shall grow sor ever renewed by the
praises of posterity.’ laude is abl. instr. constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with
crescam and recens. Horace says he will grow for ever, because the
praisae of meh generation of posterity will renew his vigour. recens is
‘fresh' in the sense ‘vigorous, ‘unwearied.'

8. dum capitolium etc. The allusion is obscure. It is said (on
the authority os Johannes Lydus, a writer of the 6th century) that the
Pontifex Maximus and the Virgo Maxima (chief of the Vestals) ascended
to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, on the Ides of March, to pray sor
the welfare of the Roman state.

Kiessling connects dum—pontifix with dicar.

10. qna-Annuus et qua—populorum. These clauses are commonly
supposed to be explanatory of ax humili potens, or of deduxisse: ‘ l shall
be told os (as one who), where the Aufidus roars’ etc.‚ ‘first introduced
Aeolian song! The inversion is harsh, and the statement that it involves

, Γ entirely untme, for Horace never wrote a line of poetry at Venusia.
β’ *Horace expects, rather, that pilgrims will visit his birthplace and the
Venusians will hear and speak, with awe, of his glory. '

obdunt Aufidus, cf. lv. 9. 2 longe sonantem natu} ad Aufidum.

ιι. pauper aquae. For the gen. cf.·111. 6. 17 fecunda culpae.
Apulia is oelled sittiulosa in Epod. 3. 16.

λ Αια. regnavit populorum, a Greek gen. (Introd. p. xxii), like ἦρξε
“wll-

ex humili potens, applied by Bentley to Daunus, who made him-
sels king of Apulia. The words apply more probably to Horace himself
