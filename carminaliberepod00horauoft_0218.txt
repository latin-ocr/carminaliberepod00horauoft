174 HORACE, ODEs 1. xii—xiv.

garder. hThe ‘star’ of course is supposed to control the fortunes of
aesar s ouse.

49. gentis humanae, etc. The enumeration began with Jupiter
{Ingfftzrjds vv1th hun. So Aratus says ἐκ Διος ἀρχώμεσθα καὶ ἐς Δία λήγετε·

. 51, 52. Cf. Ovid Metam. xv. 858 Iuppiter arces Temperat aethe·
reas et mundi regna trfformz's: Terra sub Augusto .· pater est et rector
uterque.

53. seu Parthos, etc. The point seems to be that Augustus will
always acknowledge the supremacy of Jove, even in the hour of his
most splendid triumphs.

54. 1usto...tr1umpho (with egerit, not with domitos). iustus means
‘legitimate‚' ⁴ regular‚' ‘fairly won.' A triumph was iustus if the general
who claimed it was dictator, consul or praetor, and had himself con-
ducted the battle.. The battle must have been with a foreign foe, have
decided the campaign and have caused the destruction of 5000 of the
enemy.

56. Seraz, the Chinese. (The English word ‘ silk’ is derived from
the adj. Sericus.) The Chinese were dimly known to the Romans as
having interfered in the affairs of Parthia. .

ι 57. to minor, cf. 111. 6. 5 (Romane) dis te minorem quod gerit,
znzperas.

59. parum castis, ‘ polluted.’

Ode ΧΙΙΙ.

To Lydia. The ode is probably imitated from the Greek and there
is no reason to identify this Lydia with her of Ι. 8 or with any girl of
Horace’s acquaintance.

Scheme. Lydia, when you speak of Telephus with praise and when
I see how he treats you, I burn with jealousy. So rude a boy cannot
be a constant lover. How much better is a love that will never be
broken by quarrels.

Metre. The Third Asclepiad-

6 1.d Telephi. The name is used again for a pretty youth in 111. 19.
2 an 1v. 11. αι.

2. corea, ‘ waxen ’ in colour. Flavius Caper, a very early gram-
marian, read lactea, which many edd. adopt.

4. mom, ‘ill-tempered,' ‘angry.'

iecur. The liver was supposed to be the seat of the violent passions
whether of jealousy (as here) or of love (as in ιν. 1. 12 si torrere iecur
quaeris idoneum).

8. quam. Kiessling connects quam with penitus, and points out
that Horace generally uses quam with an adverb (as in 11. ¹3· τι).
9. uror, ‘ I burn’ with rage.

10. turparunt, ‘ have stained with bruises.'
