A lampoon on a certain freedman, who, by his wealth, had managed
to become eques and tribunus militum.

Who the freedman in question was, cannot now be ascertained. In
ancient times the grammarians identified him either (1) with Sextus
Pompeius Menas or Menodorus‚ a freedman of S. Pompeius, who
deserted to Octavian in B.c. 38 and was by him raised to equestrian
rank, and otherwise rewarded (Dion C. XLvm. 45): or (α) with one
Vedius Rufus, whom Kiessling supposes to have been that P. Vedius,
a rich friend of Cn. Pompeius, whom Cicero met in Laodicea and
considered a ridiculous person (ad Alt. vl. 1. 25). Menas is'said to be.
referred to in Carm. 111. 15. 16.
