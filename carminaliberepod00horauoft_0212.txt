168 HORACE, ODES 1. ix, x.

jar would contain Sabine wine, just as a Laestrygonian jar (111. 16. 34)
contains Formian. Sabine wine was cheap (1. 20. 1).

9. qui simul: nam simul atque illi.

11. · depr-uelimus, ‘ fighting it out on the boiling sea.’ Cf. decer-
tantem m 1. 3. 13.

cupressi, tall trees growing on the plain.
12. veteres orm, gnarled old rowan trees on the hillside.

13. quid sit futurum. This is the advice of an Epicurean (Epicuri
de grege porcus as Horace describes himself in Epist. 1. 4. 16), but the
Epicureans would not have said permitte divis cetera, because they be-
lieved that the gods were whko indifferent to mankind.

fuge quaerere. Cf. suge suspicari in 11. 4. 22. Another device to
avoid a negative imperat. pres. is used in mitte sectari (1. 38. 3).

14. quem...cumque‚ quemcumque dierum: ‘ whatever kind of day.'
15. appone, ‘ set it down to profit,’ a metaphor from book-keeping.
16. puer with the predicate: ‘ while you are a boy.'

neque tu choreas, ‘nor dances either.’ Tu merely renews the
emphasis, as in Epp. 1. 2. 63 hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catenis.

i.e. of habits and likes and dislikes: so ‘ faddish.’

nunc, i.e. while you are young.
18. areae, ‘ piazzas,’ open spaces in Rome surrounded by porticoes.

22. gratus. The arrangement of the epithets latentis proditor
intimo and the substs. puellae risus angulo suggests that gratus is here
the predicate: ‘is sweet.’ (So Kiessling.) Most edd. understand
repetantur as belonging to this sentence too. Wickham translates ‘the
tell-tale laugh from the secret corner that betrays the hiding girl!

ang-ulo, probably the corner of the vestibulum, a dark passage
leading from the street to the sront door.

23. pignus, ‘forfeit’: a bracelet or ring which the young man
keeps till the girl redeems it.

24. male pertinaci, ‘seebly resisting.’ For maleas a quasi-negative
cf. male sanus, male fidus.

1. On the caesura, see Introd. p. xxix.

facunde, λόγιος. Cf. Martial vn. 74. 1 Cyllenes caelique decus,

Barnabas Jupiter and Paul Mercury‚ because he was the chief speaker.'
