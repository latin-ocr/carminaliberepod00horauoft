xxii INTRODUCTION.

To a writer with this faculty, it matters little that his ideas are
scanty and commonplace. His readers have the less trouble
in understanding him and agreeing with him, and can surrender
.themselves to the charm of his diction. It is because we all
find in Horace ‘what oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd’
that he has been used, for so many ages, as the indispensable
model of literary excellence.

§4 Some Characteristics os Horace's Latz‘m‘ty.

Horace's Latin is a good deal affected by the conciseness
which, as we have just said (p. xx) was demanded by the
perpetually recurring emphases of lyric poetry. For the sake
of brevity he often used expressions which may be called
‘short cuts‚' intended to avoid unemphatic prepositions and
conjunctions, and to bring important words closer together.
The most striking instances of this practice are his use of the
genitive case and of the infinitive mood. His freedom in the use
of these constructions-was undoubtedly imitated from the Greek,
though it is not always possible to produce a Greek parallel for
every Horatian instance.

1. The following are examples, in the Odes, of unusual
genitives z diva potens Cypri (1. 3. ι), agrestium regnavit
populorum (111. 30. 11), desine querelarum (11. 9. 17, 18), absti-
neto irarum (111. 27. 69, 70), integer vitae scelerisque purus (1.
22. 1), patriae exul (11. 16. 19), prosperam frugum (lv. 6. 39),
fertiles frugum (Carm. Saec. 29), secunda culpae (111. 6. 17),
pauper aquae (111. 30. 11), dives artium (lv. 8. 5), docilis modorum
(IV. 6. 43), probably also notus animi paterni (11. 2. 6, though
these words need not be construed together)¹.

2. The infinitive mood is often used by Horace, as it is
often used in Greek, where in prose a final or a consecutive

¹ The Greek constructions imitated are such as βασιλεύειν Πύλου,
λήγειν ἀοιδῆς, ἁγνὸς αἵματος, φυγὰς ’Δρ-γους, πλούσιος χρυσίου, μαθητικὸς
μουσικῆς, θαυμάζειν τινὰ τοῦ νοῦ.
