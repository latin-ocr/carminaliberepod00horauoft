Ode xvu.

To Maecenas, when he was in ill· health. He suffered from fever

(perpetua febrts Pliny N. H. vn. 51) and sleeplessness. He died Β. c. 8,
only a few months before Horace.

Scheme. Your dismal complaints take the life out of me, Maecenas.
The gods have determined‚ and Ι have resolved too, that we shall die
t-ogether Why should Ι live when you are gone? 1 will follow you,
like a loyal comrade, to the grave. Our natal stars agree. Jupiter
snatched you from a bed of death: Faunus preserved me from a falling
tree. We both of us owe a sacrifice of thanksgiving for our salva-
tion.
