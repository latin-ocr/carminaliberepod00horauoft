BOOK IV.

PRELIMINARY NOTE.

Tun following summary of peculiarities in the composition of the
F ourth Book is taken mainly from Orelli. In the 16 odes, eight different
metrae are employed. In the caesura of the Sapphic line and the
diaeresis of the Alcaic, Horace has resumed the freedom which he
avoided in the Third Book (see Introd. pp. xxviii, xxix). Elisions are
more rare and a long vowel is nowhere elided except in 1. 35. The
initial syllables of the Alcaic stanza are always long. Hiatus between the
lines is avoided and a short syllable is nowhere lengthened. There is a
large number os words which Horace uses alone or sor the first time:
such are faustitas, beluosus, tauriformis, domabilis, inimicare, apprecari,
obarman, renascere, aeternare. The uses of spargier also, and surpuerat
and ni and divum (sor divorum) and quandoque (1. 17) are unparalleled
in the lyrics. The style is usually less terse than in the earlier works
and is sometimes downright prosaic.

Ode Ι.

Scheme. Dost thou call me again to arms, Venus ? Nay, spare me ε
1 am not the man 1 was. Go rather to Paulus Maximus, the young,
the beautiful, the brave. He, if he triumphs, will give thee fit reward.
As for me, 1 am too old to love. And yet my team, my stammering
tongue, belie me, and all my thoughts are on Ligurinus.

The ode is placed first with a purpose. The nucleus os Book ιν.
consisted of the serious poems numbered 4 and 14. (See Jntrod.
p. xiv.) But Horace has said several times (1. 6 and 11. 12 are
conspicuous instances) that his Muse was playful and not adapted to
losty memes, and he evidently preferred his lighter compositions to the
more serious and dignified. By beginning the book with this ode, he
δέη his best soot foremost.' See 'also the opening lines of the last

e, 15. 1-4.
