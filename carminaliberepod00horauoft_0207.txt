ι NOTES. 163

f The dative aliti, which is the only alternative, is confirmed by Epist.

,ι 1. 19. 3 camina quaescribuntur aquae potoribus and Sat. 1. ιο. 15 illi
smpta quibus comoedia prisca viris est, where potoribus and viris are,
almost beyond question, dative. But the dative of the agent with simple
tenses passive is uncommon even in poetry. Vergil's neque cernitur ulli
(Aen. 1. 440) and Ovid’s non intelligor ulli (T rist. v. 10. 35) are not good
instanceS, the dat. here being partly that of ‘ the person interested.'

Vario. L. Varius-Rufus (about ΒΛ). 74-14) was an intimate friend
of Vergil and afterwards of Horace whom he introduced to Maecenas.
He was regarded at this time as the chief epic poet of Rome, Vergil
being known only as the author of the Eclogues and the Georgics. In
Sat. 1. ro. 51 Horace says forte epos acer ut nemo Varius ducit. He
wrote epioe on Julius Caesar and Augustus (two lines of his are quoted
in Epist. 1. 16. 27, 28) and a very popular tragedy entitled Thyestes.
ggmmd Tucca were Vergil’s literary executors‚ who saved the Aeneid

destruction.

2. Haeonfl, i.e. Homeric, for Homer was said to have been born
in Maeonia (Lydia). For the gen. cf. 111. 7. 4 constantis iuvenem

βάζω Cf. Dircaeum cycnum applied to Pindar in ιν. 2.

3. quam rom eumque. For the separation (tmesis) of quam from
cumque cf. 1. 7. 25 and 9. 14.

navium aut oquin. Of Agrippa’s military feats the most famous
were the capture of Perusia B.c. 40 and the conpuest of Aquitania 13.c.

in ιο. 36 and Actium in B.c. 31.

6. runnu uminum, the wrath of Achilles: μῆνιν Πηληιάδεω
Ἀχιλῆος, Iliad ι. 1. For stomachum cf. 1. 16. 16.

7. mumma, ⁰ wily.' πολύτροπος or πολύμητις are the stock epithets
os odysseus in Homer.

Bm This gen. (cf. Achillei in 1. 15. 34) is formed as if the nom.
were Uln‘aeem, though that nom. is not found in Latin. (See Roby Lat.
Gr. 3 43²) Tite Lat. [stix-es (for Gk. Ὀδυσσεύς) is said to be borrowed
from a Dor-ic dialect of Magna Graecia. For the x, cf. Latin Ajax,
Ajaa’s with Greek Αἴας, Αἴαντος, malaxo with μαλάσσω, etc.

8. m Pelopis domum. Apparently an allusion to Varius’
tragedy of ‘Thyestes‚’ published in 13.c. 30.

9. tmen madia. For the emphasis given by juxtaposition cf.
perfidus haupitam in 1. 15. 2.

ιο. lym potens, cf. 1. 3. 1.

votat. For the number cf. 1. 3. 10.

¹3· quis, i.e. what lyric poet, for it would be absurd to deny that
Homer or even Vanus had wrltten worthily on such themes.

mmm-atina χαλκοχίτων, Iliad 1. 371. adamas is the
bardae steel. Cf. ιιι. 24· 5.

14. pulvere—nigrum. Cf. pulvere sordidos in 11. 1. 21.
