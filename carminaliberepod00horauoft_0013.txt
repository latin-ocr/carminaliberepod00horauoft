ἓ 1. Lzse os Horace.

OUR knowledge of the life of Horace is derived chiefly from
his own works, which teern with allusions to his past history
and present occupations. A few minor details are supplied
either by the scholiasts or by a brief biography of the poet
which is found in some MSS. and which may be attributed
with certainty to Suetonius (C. Suetonius Tranquillus, flor.
ΑΔ). 150).

Quintus Horatius Flaccus1 was born on the 8th of December2

(longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum), Sat. 11. r. 34, 35 (Lucanus an
Appulus anceps Ι nam Venusinus arat finem sub utrumque colonus), and
Sat. 1. 6. 73 (where the Venusian boys are said to be magnis e
