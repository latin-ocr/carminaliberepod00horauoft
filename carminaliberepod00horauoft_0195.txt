There is no special appropriateness in Massic wine, any more than
there was in the Cyprian bark or Myrtoan sea or Icarian waves of
u. 13-15. The epit ets are (as we say nowadays) ‘realistic,’ i.e. they
create an impression that the poet has particular scenes vividly in mind.
A very fine example os the device is Milton’s

‘Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks
In Vallombrosa, where the Etruriam shades
High over-arched embower.' Par. Lost, ι. 30²·
