238 HORACE, ODES 11. xii, xiii.

abl. abs. te being omitted—‘ when you ask': or (α) poscente gov. by
magis, ⁴ more than the asker.’ The second is the more probable
and is generally preferred, but it seems an awkward compliment.
Hence Schiitz proposes that poscente=a poscente.

fgaudeat, subj. because quae is equivalent to quod ea ‘ because she

28. rapere occupet, ‘is the first to match) Cf. 1. 14. α.

ode ΧΙΙΙ.

To a tree which, by its fall, nearly killed the poet.

. Scheme. He was a rascal that planted thee and reared thee, to
murder thy innocent owner. We are all of us content to guard against
one form of death, while we neglect all the other dangers that beset us.
How narrowly 1 escaped being sent suddenly to Proserpine and Pluto
and the ghosts of the departed. I should have found Alcaeus and
Sappho charming them all with their noble poesy.

The escape here commemorated is mentioned also in 11. 17, 111. 4
and 111. 8. It happened apparently on the lst March (111. 8. 1), but
the year is not certain. It seems likely, from the allusions to Medes,
Cantabri and Scythians, that 111. 8 (which was written on the first anni·
versary of the accident) was written either in B.C. 28 or about the same
time as 11. 9, i.e. early in 13.c. 24.

1. ueruto (lie, ‘ a black day,' one of the dies atri or rellzgiosi (such
as the second day of the month) on which it was unlucky to begin any
undertaking.

2. quicumque primum, sc. posuit.

sacrilega, ‘impious.’ There was no impiety in rearing the tree,
but the tree was aecursed because the hand that reared it was that of
an impious man. In effect ‘It was a black day when you were planted,
and an impious wretch that reared you.’

3. in pgrniciem‚ ‘ to be the destruction.’ Cf. iuvenescit in mea
vota 1v. 2. 5 .

4. pagi, ‘parish’ or commune. Horace's farm apparently lay in
the pagus of Mandela (Epist. 1. 18. 105).

5. crediderim, ‘1 could believe.' Roby L. G. ἓ 1540, quoting,
among other instances, Ciceronem cuicunque Graecorum fhrtiter oppo- ·
suerz'm from Quintilian. ι

6. &egisse cervicem, by h'anging or garrotting. Cf. Sallust Cat.

gods stood, in the atrium.
