solidus est: nemo ex illo mihi quidquam enjuit. To drink wine before
dinner-time (the ninth or tenth bour) was dissipated behaviour. See

Mayor’s note on Juvenal 1. 49. In German, a loafing lazy fellow is
called a tagedieb or ‘ day-thief.’

21. arbuto. The arbutus, or strawberry-tree, forms a large bush, ⁴
often 2ο feet high.

22. lene caput, ‘a softly·murmuring spring?

sacrae. All springs were sacred, as being the haunts of water·
nymphs. Shrines (sacella) were often placed beside them.

23· lituo. The lituus was a horn bent at the end. It was used as
a bugle by cavalry.

tubae. The tuba was a straight horn, used by infantry. The lituus

Iove, ‘the sky.' Cf. Epod. XIII. 2 nivesque deducunt Iovem. sub
divo is similarly used for ‘in the open air' in 11. 3. 23, 111. ·11. 5. In 1.
22. 2ο malus Iuppiter means ‘a bad climate.'

· 28. teretes is used (in a complimentary sense) of ankles in 11. 4.
21 and of a boy in Epod. xl. 28. It is used by other writers of such
things as a thread, a wand and a pebble. It seems to combine the

Marsus aper. The Marsi lived in Latium near lacus Fucinuss For

29. doctarum, not ‘learned‚’ but ‘cultured.' Like the Greek σοφός, ’

doctus is especially applied to poets, as Tibullus 1. 4. 61 Pieridas,

Cf. Verg. Ecl. vn. 28 pastores hedera crescentem ornate poetam. -

gelidum nemus, not any real place, but the fancied grove, haunted
by the di superi and Muses and nymphs.

32—34. tibias, double pipes‚ used as an accompaniment to ckoral odes.

barbiton, a large seven-stringed lyre, such as Alcaeus (see 1. 32. 5)
*and other Lesbian poets used as an accompaniment to songs.

The tibiae and barbitos, therefore, are equivalent to lyr-ic poetry of
both kinds (cf. Introd. p. xviii). The former are here ascribed to Euterpe,
the latter to Polyhymnia, but both are attributed by Hor. to Clio
(invoked in 1. 12. 1—2) and to Calliope (invoked in 111. 4. 1-4). In xv.
3 Hor. says that he owes his inspiration to Melpomene. Evidently, he

did not know or heed the division of functions assigned to the several ι

Muses.
