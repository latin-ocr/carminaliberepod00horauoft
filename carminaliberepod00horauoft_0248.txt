204 HORACE, ODES Ι. xxxiii, xxxiv.

Lycorida. The name may be borrowed from the eleg-ies of Gallus.
See Verg. Ecl.· x. 2.

6. cyri. This name has been used in 1. 17. 2 5.

asperam, ‘unfriendly.’ She ‘bristles up’ at him. Cf. monitoribus
asper in Ars Poet. 163 and agris aspera 1. 23. 9.

7. declinat, ‘turns away' from Lycoris.

Pholoen. The name occurs also in one of Tibullus’ poems (1. 8).
Horace uses it again in 11. 5. 17 and 111. 15. 7.

Apulis lupis. Cf. 1. 22. 18.

8. iungentur capreae iupis. Cf. Verg. Ecl. vl11. 26 Mopso Nisa
datur .· quid non speremus amantes ? Iungentur iam grypes equis.

9. turpi adultero, ‘an ugly lover.’ For the abl. cf. ingenuo amore
peccas in 1. 27. 17. For adulter cf. moechos in 1. 25. 9 and also 1. 36. 18.

ιο. sic visum Veneri, ‘ such is the will of Venus.' Cf. dis aliter
visum in Aeneid ΙΙ. 428.

11. iuga. aenea.. We should say ‘iron yoke.’ The expression

16. curvantis, ‘hollowing out the round bays of Calabria.' curvare
is ‘to make curved': so Lucan vlu. 177 Scythiae curvantem litora
pontum. (Some interpret ‘curling the Calabrian waves‚’ but fretis has

‘ to make round bays‚' for the sea makes the bays and rounds them too.
Cf. confundere proelia in 1. 17. 23 ‘ to *make confused battles‚' and
consociare umbram in 11. 3. 10 ‘to make a joint shade.’

ode xxxiv.

Scheme. 1, whose foolish philosophy made me an infrequent wor-
shipper of the gods, am now obliged to change my opinions. For 1
