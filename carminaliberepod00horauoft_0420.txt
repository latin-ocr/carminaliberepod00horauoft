loo. Esquilinae. The final syllable is shortened by the hiatus:
cf. Verg. Aen. 111. 211 insulae Ionio etc. ·

The birds of the Esquiline are the crows that fed on the bodies of
slaves, criminals and destitute persons flung there unburied or only
half-covered with earth. In Sat. 1. 8. ro Horace says of the Esquiline
miserae plebi stabat commune sepulcrum. Maecenas converted part of

the hill into a garden, but the ground outside the garden was still
covered with bones (ibid. p. αα).

101. heu, with mihi superstites.

VI.

A challenge to a satirical writer, who vented his malice only on
people who could not retaliate. It is unknown who the poet was.
Some MSS. say that he was Cassius Severus, but this person (named as
a malicious writer in Tac. Ann. 1. 72) did not die till ΑΛ). 37, nearly
70 years after this epode was written. Editors suggest either Mevius
(see Epode ιο) or Furius Bibaculus, a poet whom Horace elsewhere
derides (Sat. 11. 5. 41) and of whose writings Tacitus says (Ann. ιν.
2 3) that they were rqferta contumeliis.

vis, ‘energy,' is frequently predicat of dogs: Lucretius has promissa
canum vis (lv. 681) and fida canum vis (V1. ητα), and Vergil (Aen. lv.
132f) hasfoilotgq εαζτιινη vis. But Hor. uses vis here concretely‚ to mean

sold in winter. Dogs were not used for hunting in the snow, where the
hunted animal was already impeded and left a clear track.

ro. proiectum cibum. Weare to imagine here a dog pursuing a
thies, who drops some food in its path. The antithesis between the
brave dog and the coward is not well carried out, but Horace is always
weak in such imagery. Here he actually goes on to speak os his horns.
Cf. Carm. 111. 20 for a similar confusion.

η. cornua. Horace is a bull now, instead of a dog.

13. gener. Archilochus (cf. Epist. 1. 19. 2 5 quoted in the Intro-

which Archilochus pursued them.
