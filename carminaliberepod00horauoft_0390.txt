346 HORACE, ODES 1v. ix.

was not the only woman who was ever fired with love through ad-
miration of the braided locks of her seducer’ etc. It is true that arsit
might govem an accus. (as Verg. Ecl. 2. 1 Corydon ardebat Alexin),
but the construction would be awkward here and Horace elsewhere
uses the abl. with ardere (11. 4. 9 arsit virgine and 111. 9. 5). For
mirari of admiration leading to love cf. 1. 4. 19, Epod. 3. ιο.

14. crines. The charms of a fine head of hair, beautifully kept,
are often mentioned in classical literaturez cf. 1. 15. ¹4 and see the
article coma in Smith's Dict. ofAntiq.

illitum, literally ‘painted on,' but the reference is to designs
embroidered in gold thread: cf. Aeneid 111. 483 picturatas auri sub-
temine vestes. Eurip. Orest. 840 χρυσεοπήνητα φάρεα.

15. mutus, ‘his princely ways' t cf. feros cultus 1. 10. 2.
16. comites, ‘his suite.’

17. cydonio, i.e. Cretan, from Cydon a town in Crete: cf. calami
spicula Gnosii 1. 15. 17.

18. non semel, in effect ‘many a Troy was ravaged.’ As Kiessling
remarks, there are two series of examples introduced in nearly the same
terms ι, non sola—primus—non semel: non solus—non primus—multi
(cf. the series of nec—aut in 11. 9. 1-17). Observe the emphatic
position of these leading words.

2ο. Idomeneus Sthenelusve. Here, as in 1. 15, Horace chooses
the less famous heroes of the Trojan war.

6281. dicenda Musis proelia, cf. ,proelia coniugibus loquenda lv.
4· 0 '

22. Deiphobus was Hector‘s brother. His chief exploits are
recounted in Iliad XII. and xnl. ·

26. memmimus, ‘unwept': cf. flebilis 1. 24. 9. But illacri-
mobilis: ‘unable to weep’ in 11. 14. 6.

27. urgentur, cf. 1. 24· 5.

28. sacro. The poet is musarum sacerdos (111. 1. 3) and is under
the protection of Apollo, Bacchus and Mereury. The epithet here has
some suggestion of an active meaning: the sacer vates is one who can
sacrare, consecrare (‘immortalize’ lv. 8. 27 n.). For the thought ef.
Pindar Nem. VII. 12 ταὶ μεγάλαι γὰρ ἀλκαὶ σκότον πολὺν ὕμνων ἔχοντι
δεόμεναιε and Tac. Agr. 46 multos veterum velut inglorios et ignobiles
oblivio obruet.

29. sepultae and celata as Wickham says, belong in thought both
to inertiae and to virtus. ‘ Once in the grave, valour differs little from
cowardice‚ if they be unrecorded’: cf. 11. 15. 18 n.‚ Epod. 5. 37.

inertiae dat.‚ cf. dzfftrt sermoni in Sat. 1. 4. 48.

31. chartis with inornatum, not with silebo: ‘I will not leave you
unadorned with a poem of mine.’ inornatum is proleptic: ‘I will not
be silent about you, so that you are unadorned.’ Lollius was already
ornatus, ‘distinguished.’
