not quite certain and classe reparavit ought to mean ‘procured in
exchange for her fleet.’ Hence the numerous conjectures mentioned in
the critical note.

25—32. Here follow at least three parallel adjectival clauses,
beginning ausa—firocior—invidens. (Most editors even make four,
regarding sortis et tractare etc. as a separate clause.) This is regarded
as a sign of Horace’s imperfect command of the metre. ,

25. iacentem, ‘grief-stricken.’ regiam is ‘her court.’ Cleopatra
was taken to her palace after her capture by Proculeius.

26. fortis is more conveniently taken with vultu screno in which

asperas, ‘angry.' , .
28. combiberet. It is a well-known tale that Cleopatra caused
herself to be bitten by an asp.

29. deliberata...ferooeor‚' ‘ more proud than ever when she had
resolved to die.' delib. morte is abl. abs.

30. Liburms, dat. after invidens: ‘ begrudging the fierce Libur-
nians.' Some edd. however regard Liburnis as abl. of Liburnae i.e.
‘ Liburnian ships ’.(cf. Epod. 1. 1), notwithstanding the epithet saevis.

31. privata, ⁴dethroned‚' ‘unqueened.'

dedum is direct obj. to inm'dens: ‘begrudging that she should be led!
32. non humma, ‘haughty‚' cf. 1. 18. 9 non levis.

2. phnyra, ‘ bast.' philyra is properly the Greek name of the
lime-tree, called in Latin tilia. The inner bark os this tree was used for
tying garlands‚ or sometimes the flowers were stitched on it (hence
sutiles coronae).

3. mitte=omitte, cf. 111. 8. 17.
quo locorum=qu0 loco only.
5. myrto, the plant sacred to Venus.

It is dependent on curo: cf. volo factas etc. ‘ 1 am particular that
you do not trouble to add.’ -
