Ode XXXVU.

Scheme. Now we may drink and dance and set feasts before the
gods, for Cleopatra is no more—Cleopatra who threatened our destruc-
tion. But her frenzied hate received a shock at Actium and turned into
terror when Caesar pursued her, as a hawk pursues a dove. But she
was a brave woman, fearing no shape of death, and too proud to figure
as a captive in a Roman triumph.

This ode was evidently written in the autumn of Β. c. 30, when
Rome, after hearing of the capture of Alexandria and the death of
Antony, received the further news of the suicide of Cleopatra. The
odeis to some extent imitated from one by Alcaeus (see Introd. p. xxxix)
on the death of Myrsilus, and appears to be one of Horace' s earliest
attempts in the Alcaic metre. (See ll. 5 and 14.)

2. sanai-ibus dapibus, ‘with feasts fit for the Salii.' The college
of Salii were renowned for their choice dinners. Cf. also 11. 14. 28

3. ornare pulvinar deorum. The reference is to the ceremony of

a lectisternium, in which the images of the gods were brought out into
the street, placed m pairs on sosas (pulvinaria) and served with a feast.
