qui procul negotiis etc.

per dies festos probably means ‘ every holiday‚’ as per autum·
nos in 11. 14. 15 and per exactos annos in 111. 22. 6. Dies festi are the
same as dies feriati and formed part of the dies nefasti, on which no
legal business could be conducted. They are marked le in the
calendars (meaning perhaps nefastus feriae ublicae) and there were
between 60 and 70 such days in the year in orace's time, besides the
various ludi, which lasted many days together, especially in autumn.

Ben Jonson on Bacon:

‘ Whose even thread the Fates spin round and full
Out of their choicest and their finest woo1.’
