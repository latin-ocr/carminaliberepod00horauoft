Lm. 1. xviii--xx. 21

hic vivum mihi caespitem, hic
verbenas, pueri, ponite turaque

bimi cum patera meri: 15
mactata veniet lenior hostia.

XX.

Vile potabis modicis Sabinum
cantharis, Graeca quod ego ipse testa
conditum levi, datus in theatro

cum tibi plausuS,

care Maecenas equeS‚ ut paterni 5
fluminis ripae simul et iocosa
redderet laudes tibi Vaticani

montis imago,

Caecubum et prelo domitam Caleno
tu †bibes uvam: mea nec Falernae 10
temperant vites neque Formiani

pocula colles,

xx. ro. Tu bibes is the reading of the MSS. but it can hardly be
right. Hor. is not likely to have written potabis in l. 1 meaning ‘ you
vin drink at my house ’ and bibes in 1. ιο meaning ‘you can drink at
your own house.’ Porphyrion (on Sat. 11. 2. 48) quotes the words as
Dant bibes and many edd. print this, rendering it ‘ Afterwards you shall
drink Caecuban and Calenian.’ But these wines were the best and
most expensioe, whereas the point of the ode is that Hor. was poor
(ef. vile and modicis in 1. ι). Resides, tu is supported by the emphatic
mea which follows. Of many conjectures (eg. bibas, liques, moves)

ἰ the best is Munro's tu vides, meaning ⁸ you provide,' as in Cic. ad All.
ἓ v. 1. 3, ut prandium nobis videret and elsewhere.
