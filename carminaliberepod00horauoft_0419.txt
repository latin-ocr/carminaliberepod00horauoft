ι No‘rEs. 375

71. mutus, cf. Carm. 1. 27. 21 quis te solvere Thessalis Magus
Μία-...ῥοπή

76. flatui.. The Marsi were noted for skill in sorcery: cf. 17. .
²9 ῗὲὶξῖῒ. Kiessling follows Porphyrion in interpreting redibit:
redibit ad te: ‘ you shall not recover your mind, though you try to
*recall it with Marsian incantations.’ But it is far more probable that
redibat: redibit ad me (like ad me recurres) and that the sense is: ‘Your
mind, it seems, will not return to me at the call of mere Marsian
incantations.’ Thus Marsae voces corresponds to usitatae potiones.

77. maius param, sc. aliquid (not with poculum).

lamudam. infundere (with dat.) is the usual word for ‘adminis-
tering ' a medicine or poison.

8². utun, ‘smoky.’

83. nub haec, ‘at these words.’

84. lenire, historic infin. Roby L. G. ς 1359.

85. nmo, ‘with what beginning,’ just as Dido (Aen. 1v. 371), in
her anger at her betrayal, eries Quae quibus anteferam ?

86. Thyesteas preces, i. e. curses such as Thyestes uttered when
he found that Atreus had slain his children and cooked their flesh.
There was a famous passage of Ennius, describing this curse, quoted by
Cicero Tusc. 1. 44. 107.

88. humanam vicem=lzominum vicem, ἀνθρώπων δίκην ‘like men’:
cf. Cic. Att. x. 8. 7 Sardanapali vicem in suo lectulo mori. The adj.
humanam is almost pronominal = nostram vicem. The sense is, ‘ Poisons
cannot change the mighty laws of right and wrong in the same way as

they change mene

A more favourite interpretation (due to Lambinus) divides the
sentence into two and takes valent positively with the first, leaving non
‘valent to the second, thus: ‘Poisons can overset right and wrong but
cannot overset human vengeance) But, besides the difficulty of such
Latin, there are two objections to the sense: (1) How can poisons be
said to overset right and wrong? and (2) convertere means ‘to turn
’upsige <{lown’ and how can human vengeance be said to be turned
upsi e own? ‘

89. dms, ‘curses.’ Cf. Tac. Ann. vl. ²4 meditatas compositasque
diras imprecabalur.

ωτι mdo. A solemn cursing before the gods. Cf. Livy x.
⁴¹ dira exsecratio ac furiale carmen detestandae familiae stirpique com-

ponam qm. The sense runs, in effect, ⁶ 1 curse you before the gods ι
nay, 1 will haunt you myself.'

92. mter, used as masculine offuria ‘ a fury)

bagm- vifathn, ‘street by street,’ cf. ostiatim. hinc et hinc ‘from
