236 HORACE, ODES 11. xii.

Ode ΧΙΙ.

To Maecenas, for whom see 1. 1 and Introd. p. xiii.

Scheme. You would not like the stirring history of our race or the
feats of heroes to be told in lyric verse, Maecenas. The exploits of
Caesar, too, you can tell yourself better in prose. No: my theme
shall be the beauty and constancy and grace of Licymnia, whom you
would not exchange for all the wealth of Orient. Cf. 1. 6.

Metre. Fourth Asclepiad (Introd. p. xxx).
1. nolis, ‘ you would not wish.’

longa...Numantlae. Numantia, a stronghold of the Celtiberi in
Spain, resisted the Romans for 10 years, butwas ultimately taken by
the younger Scipio in 13.c. 133. Many of the inhabitants killed them-
selves rather than surrender.

2. Siculum mare. The reference is to the battles of Mylae
ἑζὲοῇἷεόῒοὲυᾙῐὶιξὲιονῗὲῗ (.B.c. 256), and the Aegatian islands (13.c. 241) in

4. aptari, ‘ to be set to the soft strains of the lute.'
5. Lapithas, cf. 1. 18. 8.

nimium mero, ‘ made insolent with wine,’ cf. rebus secundis nimii in

Tacitus fIz‘st. IV. 23. nimius literally means ‘too big' and so ‘ puffed
u .

p 6. Hylaeum, one of the Centaurs who made a riot at the marriage

of the Lapith Peirithous. Vergil also (Georg. 11. 457) names him as
Lapithis cratere minantem.

Herculea manu, cf. 1. 3. 36 n.

7. Telluris iuvenes, the giants who tried to scale Olympus and
whom the gods could not conque'r without the help of a mortal. For
this reason, Zeus asked sor the assistance of Hercules.

unde=a quibus: cf. 1. 12. 17 and 1. 28. 28.

perieulum gov. by contremuit. Cf. Aeneid 111. 648 sonitumque
pedum vocemque tremesco.

9. satum veteris, ‘ the shining halls of ancient Saturn ' doubtless
became the abode of Jupiter, but the expression suggests that Horace
has made some confusion between the Titanomachia and the Giganto·
machia. Saturn (or Kronos) with the Titans fought against Jupiter.
After the deposition of Satum, Jupiter fought against the giants.

tuque, ‘ and you yourself, Maecenas! Servius (on Verg. Georg.
11. 42) states that Maecenas wrote a history of Augustus, but we know
