288 HORACE, ODES 111. xi, xii.

10. exultim, ἅπαξ λε’γ. ‘skittishly.’

12. cruda, ‘unripe.' Cf. tempestiva viro in 1. 23. 12, and iam
matura viro in Aeneid vn. 53. The lesson of the Danaids seems to
be meant for a married woman, and Lyde may have been a wife who
kept her husband at a distance. (Cf. virginum in l. 26.)

15. tu, addressed to the lyre. It was the lyre of Orpheus that
stopped rivers and moved trees and charmed Cerberus: cf. 1. 12. 93
1. 24. 14: Vergil, Georg. IV. 481 sqq.- ·

comites with ducere, ‘lead in thy company.’ comites is predicative
to tigres as well as to silvas. For the position of -que cf. 1. 30. 6 n.

15. immanis with aulae which requires some defining epithet-
Orpheus went down to Hades to fetch back his wife Eurydice.

17. furiale. The heads of the Furies also were garnished with snakes.

20. ore trfflngui (11. ¹9· 31), i.e. ‘his triple mouth.’ Cerberus
was usually imagined with three heads (Aeneid Vl. 417 latratu tri-
fauci), but Horace in 11. 13. 34 speaks of him as belua centiceps. In the
compound trilinguis tri- is here the essential part, lingui· adding a
picturesque suggestion. So in Aeschylus (Septem 284) ἑπτατειχεῖς
ἐξόδους means ‘seven gates‚’—·reaxe?s suggesting the walls which the gates
pierced.

21. quin et, cf. 11. 13. 37, a passage very similar to this.-

'rityoffi 111. 5. 77.
22. risit, for the singular verb cf. 1. 3. 10 n.

urna, the jug with which the Danaids attempted to fill the sieve or
bottomless cask. See below on dolium, 1. 27.

26. virginum seems to have special point. The Danaids murdered
their husbands on the marriage night. The gen. virginum depends on
scelus as well as on poenas.

inane lymphae donum, ‘the cask that will not fill with the water
that runs out at the bottom. lymphae depends on inane3 cf. plenus
with gen. and Cic. de Orat. Ι. 37 omnia nonne plena consiliorum,
inania verborum videmus ?

27. dolium is a large earthenware jar, in Greek πίθος, so large that
Diogenes the Cynic lived in one.

pereuntis, that ‘runs away’ and is lost. Cf. Sat. 1. 2. ¹33 ne
nummi pereant.

The fifty daughters of ganaus were betrothed to their cousins, the
fifty sons of Aegyptus: but as Danaus suspected the young men of
intending to supplant his power in Argos, he made his daughters
promise to murder them on the marriage-night. They all did so except
Hypermnestra, who let her husband Lynceus escape. (Cf. Aeseh.
Prom. Vinctus, 865 sqq.) For this crime, according to the Alexandrian
poets, the Danaids were condemned, in Hades, to labour at filling with
water a cask pier'ced with holes.
