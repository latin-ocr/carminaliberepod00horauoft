⁴206 HORACE‚ ODES 1. xxxv.

Ode XXXV.
To Fortune.

Scheme. Goddess of Antium, ruler of the lives of mortals‚ the poor
rustic, the sailor, the barbarian, all peopleS, cities and kings worship
thee. Necessity marches before thee: Hope and Faith attend thee and
follow thee, when false friends flee. Preserve our Caesar who is going
to Britain and our army that is going to Arabia. We are ashamed of
our civil strifes: sharpen thou our swords against the foreign soe.

The word fortuna in Latin (like nature or indeed fortune in
English) is used in several senses which Horace here confuses. It
means (1) the force that controls events: (2) events themselves, and
(3) the condition produced by events, namely‚ the prosperity or adversity
of a nation, family or person. In each of these aspects for‘tuna may be
personified, and Horace uses all three personifications. In ll. 1—16‚
Fortuna is the goddess who rules human life: in 17-20‚ she is life itself
orl history, preceded by Necessity: in 21-28 she is fortuna domus, the

however, are not imagined distinctly by Horace and he in places
confuses his imagery.

Metre. Alcaic.

ι. gratum Antium, ‘your dear Antium’ (ef. 111. 26. 9). Antium
is a promontory in the Volscian territory, where there was a famous
temple and oracle of two Fortunae. They are supposed to have been
Prospera and Adversa, but this is a mere conjecture from the fact that
one is represented wearing a helmet and the other wearing a fillet.
Fortuna singly is usually represented with a comucopiae and a rudder.

2. praesens, ‘ready' and so ‘able.' Cf. Psalms xlvi. 1 ‘a very
present help in trouble.’ So praetenuis-simum remedium ‘ a most
efficacious remedy.’

3. mortale cernue, contemptuously ‘ a mere unit of mortality.’ ⁷

4. memma, abl„ vertere being equivalent to mutare. Cf. 1. 16.
26 n. and vertere seria ludo in Ars Poet. 226.

5. pauper, the poor husbandman is contrasted with the rich
merchant (cf. 1. 31. ιο).

7. Bithyna.. Cf. Pontica pinus in 1. 14. 11.
lacessit, ‘ tempts.’

8. car-patmum pelagus, so called from the island Carpathus,
between Rhodes and Crete.

9. asper, perhaps ‘ fierce' as lagnis aspera in 1. 23. 9. Wickham
suggests that the Dacian‚ who stands at bay, is contrasted with the
Scythian‚ who eludes pursuit. But asper may mean ‘unkempt' and
contrast the savage Dacian and Scythian with the civilised urbesque
gentesque et Latium ferox.

A verb must be supplied for all these nominatives either from ambit
in 5 or metuunt in 12.
