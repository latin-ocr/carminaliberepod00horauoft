ode Vl.

Scheme. We have courted disaster by neglect of religion. The
Parthians, the Dacians, the Egyptians have all come near to destroying
us. But im urity in the household is our gravest offence‚ and has led
to a steady Xegeneration of our race-

The ode was obviously written about B.c. 28, when Augustus, as he
himself says in the Monumentum Ancyranum, restored 82 temples,
nullo praetermisso quod rq‘ici debebat. The lex Julia de adulteriis
comendis was probably not passed till 13.c. 17, but Augustus had

doubtlaes much earlier declared his intention of carrying out the moral
reforms which Julius Caesar had begun.

1. immeritus, concessive, ‘though guiltless yourself.’

τ. Romane. For the form of address cf. Aeneicl VI. 852 tu regere
imperio populos, Romane, memento.

templa...aodu‚ ‘temples’ and ‘shrines.’ The words are not quite
synonyms. A templum was properly a square plot of ground, marked
out with certain ceremonies by an augur: an aedes was a building,
the shrine os some god. Hence some places (eg. the Rostra and
the Curia were templa, though not shrines: and some shrines (e.g.
the rou temple of Vesta) were aedes but not templa. But, in the
time of Augustus, templa and aedes were practically synonyms, though
probably the name templum was used rather for large magnificent
templa, while the older name aedes was used for the older and smaller
temples. (See the article Templum in Smith’s Dict. of A ntiq. 3rd ed.)

3. labenda, ‘ crumbling.' The epithet belongs to templa as well.

⁴t² fumo. Many temploe had been burnt, as Suetonius expressly
men rons.

5. din minorem. Cf. 1. ια. 57 te minor latum reget aequus orbem.
‘ You hold your sway because you behave as subject to the gods!

6. hmo, from the gods. Est may be supplied, as in Verg. Ecl. 3.
60 ab love principium, but pete (as implied in refer) gives better sense.

huc, to the gods.
molvium is scanned as princtpjum, like consilium in 111. 4. 41.
