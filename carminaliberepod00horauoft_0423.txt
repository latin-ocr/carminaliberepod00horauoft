NOTES. 379

Antony allowed his soldiers to serve in Cleopatra’s body-guard and
ordered them to inscribe her name on their shields.

13. vallum. The vallus was a branched stake used for palisading
the ωιτη). Each Roman soldier carried three or four of them (cf. Verg.

Georg. 111. 346, 347).

¹4· servire, ‘act the slave) potest, ‘endures,’ as in 111. 11. 31:
cf. Greek τλῆναι.

15. turne. Some edd. take this as an exclamation, ‘ Fie !’‚ but it
goes well with canapium. The Romans regarded the oriental mosquito-
curtain as a disgusting piece of effeminacy. So Propertius (1v. 11. 45)
spmks of foeda conopia (conopium=xwv‘m⁷re20v).

17—38. Τὴε remainder of the ode cannot now be interpreted with
certainty, but a consistent theory can be formed on the following facts:

(a) At the battle of Actium, the army of Octavian lay on the north
side of the narrow strait which connects the Ambracian gulf with the
Ionian sea. The gulf was on its left. It may be guessed that the fleet
lfialy ffiralglell with the army, so that, if defeated, it might retreat to a

en y ore.

(b) Some days before the battle, Cn. Domitius deserted to Octavian,
geetending that he was disgusted with the behaviour of Cleopatra.

iotams, king of Galatia, and Amyntas, king of Pisidia, also deserted,
but their reasons are not stated.

(c) Antony had already lost the naval squadron of N asidicus and
had suffered several deseats on land.

(d) Cleopatra was strongly in favour of a hasty retreat to Egypt ;
and deserters must have brought this news to the Romans.

(e) On the day of battle, the fleet of Antony did not come out to
fight till the late asternoon. (See Merivale's Romans under tlte Empire
111. pp. 317-324‚ where the authorities are cited.)

1t is reasonable to suppose that Horace, on the morning of the
battle, believed that the enemy were skulking, that victory was assured
and that Antony himself had fled.

¹7· at hul! Hui l, an exclamation of smpfise, is not necessarily
undignified, but its rarity in serious poetry would inevitably lead to
corruption of the text.

There is some objection to any other reading that makes sense.
Porphyrion perhaps read hoc frementeszlzoc dedzknatt) as if the Gauls
deserted to Caesar because they loathed the luxury of Antony's camp.
But the use ofsremere with acc. is very rare and is not likely here in
close proximity to equos, since fremere properly means ‘to snort’ or
‘neigh.’ At huc is not appropriate is Hor. was on shipboard, nor is at
hinc (i-e. ⁸ away from Antony’). Ad hoc (⁶ at this ’) spoils the vividness
of the passage. Prof. Housman suggested at nunc. Dr Postgate,
adopting this‚·thinks that ll. 17—32 should be placed aster l. 38.

18. omn, i.e. Galatians. A horde of Gauls, who had travelled as
sar as Asia Minor, settled about n.c. 239 in the district called aster them
Galatia or Gallo-Graecia.
