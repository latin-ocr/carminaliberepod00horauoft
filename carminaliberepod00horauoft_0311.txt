seat of govemment from Rome to the East. According to Suetonius
(lul. Caes. 79) there was a rumour, even in Julius Caesar's time, that he
meant to migrate to Alexandria or Troy itself translatis simul opibus

to Rome in the Eam, and Augustus must have felt (and may have said)
that Rome ω inconveniently far from those provinces which most
claimed his attention. The general interest in the question is shown by
the speech on the pro sed migration to Veii, which Livy (V. 53, 54)

ve expressed himselfso decidedly on.the matter without the sanction
of Augustus, or at least of Maecenas.
