In these instances (and many more might have been given)
there is usually little to be said in favour of one reading and
against the other, and the MSS. are very fairly divided between
the two. But the MSS. which agree in one reading do not
agree in the next, and very often indeed both readings together
are recorded in the same MS.

One or two examples will illustrate the extreme perplexity of
the authorities. In C. 1. 2. 18 the absurd reading jactat velorum
(for ultorem) appears in seven MSS. φψλῖδεπ. It would
naturally be supposed that these MSS. were derived from one
source, but in Ι. 4. 8, λῐπ read urit while φψδε read visit (which
λῖ also record as a variant). In 1. 9. 6 φψδπ have the absurd
reading largiri potis for large reponens, but in 8. 2 δπ have hoc
deos oro, while φψ have te deos oro. Again, only three MSS.
Mu omit the line 1. 5. 13, but 12. 26, which is also omitted in λί,
is not omitted in u, but is omitted in bawL. One is perpetually
baffled by difficulties of this kind in attempting to trace the
history and connexions of our MSS. It would seem that the'
monks‚ who wrote our copies, had more than one text before
thern, or one text smothered with notes and corrections, and as
most of the copies were made about the same time, it is im-
possible to distinguish two or three of them as being the source,
or as representing the source, of all the rest.

A very large body of marginal notes or scholia on Horace
has come down to us. They are in the main derived from two
commentaries on Horace, written by Pomponius Porphyrion
and Helenius Acron. Porphyrion appears to have lived about
A.D. 200, and Acron still earlier, for he is cited (on Sat. 1. 8. 25)
by Porphyrion. But the notes which we now have under the
