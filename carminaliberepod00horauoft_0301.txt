odes Ι-νΙ.

These six great odes, all written in the same metre, are connected .
together by an obvious unity of purpose, so much so that some ancient
critice regarded them as forming a single poem. Their purpose is, as
Prof. Th. Mommsen has explainedl, to magnify the policy with which
A opened his regime in January n.c. 27.

e history of the time is briefly this. Octavian returned to Rome,
aster the conquest of Egypt, in B-C. 29. He was consul for that year
and still retained the extraordinary powers as triumvir which had been
conferred on him as far back as 13.c. 43. In B.c. 28 he was consul
again and also received censorial power, by virtue of which he purged
the senate and reconstituted the nobility. On Jan. 1st B.c. 27 he
reigned his extraordinary powers, but received in return the cognomen of
Augustus and proconsular power for 10 years, including the command
of nn armies and fleets and the control of all the chief provinces. He
m at the same time consul for the year, and was thus the supreme
magistrate in Rome and throughout the whole extent of the Roman
dominicus. Later on, in 13.c. 27, he left Rome for Gaul, intending to
ffioe‘d also to Britain, but a revolt of the Cantabri and Astures called

’ into Spain. During the two years (3.0. 29—27) that he spent in
Rome he restored a great number of temples and revived religious

” obnervancee, reconstituted the army, and doubtless began those reforms

in the public morals which he afterwards embodied in the Lex Iulia
maria (8.0. 18), and other similar enactments. These are the
great events of the time to which Horace alludes in these odeS.

010 L is addressed to the young men and maidens who had not
known the horrors of the civil wars. It is a general warning against

walth, luxury, ambition,

010 11. refers to the reconstitution of the legions, in which, under
the new regime, the rank and file consisted only of free-born volunteers,
while the officers were recmited from the upper classes (senatorial and
equestrim) only. The ode also impresses on all officials of the empire
the necessity of secrecy and loyalty in the discharge of their duties.
