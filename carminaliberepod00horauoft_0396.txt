352 HORACE, oDEs 1v. xiii, xiv.

semel, ‘once for all 'z as 1. 24. 16.

15. notis fastis, archives of which the contents are well known.
Everybody knows the age and antecedents of Lyce.

16. dies, ‘time.’

1 7. venus = venustas, ‘ charm.’

decens with motus, ‘gracefiil gesture’: as in Quint. 1. ιο. 26 corporis
decens et aptus motus, qui dicitur εὐρυθμία.

18. illius, unus, i. e. of the Lyce that I remember.

20. surpuerat, syncopated from sumspuerat: cf. Sat. 11. 3. 283
unum me surpite morti. Horace elsewhere uses puertia for pueritia,
divisse sor divisisse and excessemus for excersissemus.

21. Cinaram, see lv, 1. 3 n. post not of time, but of rank, as 111. 9.
6 neque erat Lydia post Chloen. ·

dotium (see critical note). The gen. depends both on felix and on
nota: cf. Sat. 1. 9. ιι ο te, Bolane, cerebri felicem and C. 11. α. 6 notus
animi paterni: ‘a sace which, next after Cinara’s, was famous for its
happy endowment of charms.'

22. facies, grammatically in apposition to the subject of spirabat
and surpuerat.

24. parem, proleptically: ‘ until you match the age of an old raven.'

26. fervidi, contrasted with the cold extinct ashes of Lyce’s beauty.

ode xiv.

To Augustus, on the ex loits of Tiberius. This ode, and the fourth,
on the exploits of Drusus, ormed the nucleus of the whole book. The
campaign took place B.c. 15.

Scheme. What honours, Augustus, can immortalize your services to
Rome? With your soldiery Drusus conquered the Genauni, while his
elder brother swept away the Rhaeti, as a torrent scours the country·
side. Yours were the men, yours the strategy‚ yours the good fortune:
for the victory happened on the very day when, fifteen years ago,
Alexandria surrendered to your arms. Now all the world owns you for
its master.

Metre. Alcaic.

1. patrum—Quiritium for the official senatus populusque Romanus.
2. plenus, ‘adequate’: cf. adplenum ‘to the full' 1. 17. ι 5.

3. in aevum, ‘for all time.'

4. titulos, inscriptions on monuments and statues: cf. ιν. 8. 13 n.
For example, later on (B.c. α), the senate and people gave to Augustus
the title pater patriae and decreed that it should be inscribed on his own
house, in the curia and on the quadriga which was dedicated to him in
his forum.

memores fastus, cf. 111. 17. 4.
