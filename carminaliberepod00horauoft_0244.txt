ode ΧΧΧΙ.

To Apollo, on the completion of his new temple on the Palatine.
This temple, promised by Octavian after the battle of Mylae B.c. 36,
was eight years in building and was dedicated with great pomp on
Oct. 24, B.c. 28. Attached to it there was a large public library and
a collection of fine sculptures.

Schema. What does the poet ask of Apollo in his new shrine ?
Not lands or flocks or gold or other kinds of wealth, such as a merchant
wius by braving the sea. A humble fare suffices for me, but grant me,

O Apollo, content, good health, a sound mind and an honour-able old ’

age, solaced by poetry.
Metre. Alcaic.

1. demnatum. dedicare deum meant to dedicate a statue of the god,
cf. Ovid, Fast. v1. 637 te quoque magnifica, Concordia, dedicat aede.
The statue of Apollo in the Palatine temple was a famous work of
Scopas (flor. circa B.c. 360) brought from Greece.

2. nov-um liquorem, cf. 1. 19. 15 n.
3. opimae, ‘ sat‚’ ‘rich': cf. Larissae campus opimae 1. 7. 11.
4. segetes, ‘ corn lands,' for which Sardinia was renowned.

5. grata is usually explained as ‘ pleasant ’ to look upon. Kiessling‚
however, suggests that feraces and grata are both predicative: ‘not that

Calabriae. Calabria was in ancient times, in spite of its drought
(hence aestuosae ef. 1. 22. 3), a famous pasture country, noted especially
for a breed of long-woolled sheep. These perhaps are the armenta of
1. 6, cf. dulce pellitis ovibus Galaesi flumen in 11. 6. 10 and also Epod.
1. 27.

d· t75 t nris, a river of Campania, flowing through the best vine-

9. premant, ‘let them prune.' For premere in the sense of ‘ check,'
‘ cut back ’ cf. Georg. 1. 156 ruris opaci Falce premes umbram.

calena. Cf. 1. 20. 9 n. The epithet belongs more strictly to vitem
and many editors read Calenam here, as Porphyrion the scholiast (Introd.
pdzxglxcrligb‘did. Compare, however, 111. 6. 38 Sabellis docta ligonibus Ver·

10. vitem is object both to premant and dedit.

11. culums (also spelt culillis). These were properly cups used by
the Pontifex and the Vestals in pouring libations. They seem to have
been large, though the word is a diminutive, somehow connected with
Greek κύλιξ ‘ a cup.'

12. Syra merce. Spikenard (cf. 11. 11. 16 Assyrio nardo and also
11. 7. 8, 111. 1. 44) and rich carpets and hangings were imported from
Syria through Tyre (111. 29. 60). For Syra cf. Marsus aper 1. 1. 28.
