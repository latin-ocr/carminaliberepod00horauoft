80 HORATI CARMINUM

XIV.

Herculis ritu modo dictus, o plebs,

morte venalem petiisse laurum

Caesar Hispana repetit penatis
victor ab ora.

unico gaudens mulier marito 5
prodeat iustis operata divis,
et soror clari ducis et decorae

supplice vitta

virginum matres iuvenumque nuper

sospitum. vos, o pueri et puellae, ιο ’

iam virum expectate. male ominatis
parcite verbis.

hic dies vere mihi festus atras

eximet curas: ego nec tumultum

nec mori per vim metuam tenente 15
Caesare terras.

mv. 11, 12. expectate is my emendation. It avoids two difficulties
at once. The Mss. have iam virum expertae male ominatis (or male
nominatis, but this seems to have been a late alteration). It is
unlikely both that Hor. allowed a hiatus in male ominatis and that he
gave any epithet to puellae which would not apply equally to pueri.
This latter objection is also strongly against iam virum expertes, a
suggestion of Cuningham (in 1721), unless, with Kiessling, we interpret
iam v. expertes ‘ boys and girls who have lost your fathers and
husbands.’ Those edd. who read expertae or expertes read also either
male ominatz's (in spite of the hiatus) or male nominatis (supposing
this to be a translation os δυσώνυμος) or Bentley’s male inominatis
(where male seems redundant). Keller, however, reads pueri et puellae
ac Ι iam virum expertae male ominatis etc.
