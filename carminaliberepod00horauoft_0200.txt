156 HORACE, onEs 1. ii, iii.

meum interfecerant, eos in exilium expuli iudiciis legitimis ultus eorum
facinus, et postea bellum inferentis rei publicae vici bis acie.y

47. n. v. iniquum, ‘intolerant of' (Wickham). -

49. triumphos, He·celebrat·ed a triple triumph on the 6th‚ 7th and
8th of Aug. B.C. 29, for victones ιιι Pannonia, at Actium and in Egypt.

50. pater, as a god, cf. Bacche pater in 1. 18. 6. The formal
title pater patriae was‘not given to Augustus till 13.C. 2.

princeps. He became princeps senatus in B.c. 29, but it is now a
generally accepted doctrine that princeps does not mean princeps senatus,
but was a mere title of respect addressed to the ‘foremost citizen’ of
Rome. (Cf. Tac. A nn. Ι. ι cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa nomine
principis sub imperium accepit.) The title had been previously used of
Pompey and of Julius Caesar, and Cicero had suggested the appointment
of a princeps civitatis to heal existing dissensions. Cf. 11. 1. 4 and see

{niele Princeps in Smith's Dic. ofAntiq. 3rd ed., and Pelham's Hist. of
ome, p. 370.

5 1. medos. The Parthians, whom Hor. identified with the Persians
(v. 22), and therefore (in the Greek manner) with the Medes.

52. te duce, ‘while thou art our leader! The words would
naturally imply that Caesar was leader of the Medes.

Ode ΙΙΙ.

The Ode is a propempticon or ‘god-speed' to the ship which was
conveying Vergil the poet to Athens. The only known voyage of
Vergil to Athens was in B.c. 19, just before his death; but the ode must
have been written earlier than that (Introd. p. xvii). See Nettleship in
Conington's Vergil, 1. p. xxiv.

The propempticon seems to have been a favourite form of composition
with Alexandrian poets. There is one in Theocritus (vn. 52, sqq.),
and the beginning of one by Callimachus is preserved. Statius (Silvae
ΠΙ. 2) wrote one in imitation of this ode.

Scheme. Ship, if thou carriest my Vergil safe, then may all the
gods preserve thee. What a courage that man had who first ventured
to brave the dangers of the deep! But there are no limits to the
impious audacity of mortals. We scale heaven itself and provoke the
just wrath of Juppiter.

Metre. The third Asclepiad (Introd. p. xxx).

r. sic. Editors cite many passages apparently parallel (see Lewis
and Short s. v. V. 1) to show that sic here must mean ‘on this condition.'
(Cf. 1. 28. 25.) The condition is stated later, νν. 7, 8 reddas...et smes.
'For the order, cf. Vergil Ecl. 9. 30 Sic tua Cyrneas fugiant examina
taxos...lncipe. In effect, vv. 1-8 would thus mean ‘O ship, preserve
my Vergil: so may the gods preserve thee.'

But 1. 4 makes this meaning absurd: for Hor. would pray that the
gods may preserve the ship on this voyage if· the ship preserves Vergil.

But the ship could not preserve Vergil unless she were herself preserved. ¹
