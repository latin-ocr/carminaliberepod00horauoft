252 HORACE, ODES 11. xviii, xix.

The tale is not found in any ancient writer, and it is possible that
Horace learnt it from a book by Maecenas called ‘ Prometheus! The

same thought is present in Epist. 11. 2. 178 quid vici prosunt aut horrea?
quidve Calabris Saltibus adiecti Lucani, si metit Orcus Grandia cum
parvis non exorabilis auro ?

36. mc, i.e. Orcus.

37. Tantali genus, Pelops. (Cf. 11. 13· 37.) The family of
Tantalus fumished‚ to Greek tragedians, a favourite example of ὕβρις,
i.e. the insolence engendered by wealth and power. Hence superbum

Tantalum in 36, and coercet ‘ curbs,' ‘tames': as in Sat. 1. 3. 134 fuste
coerces.

38. levare functum etc. For the complicated constr. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ
cf. lntrod. p. xxv.

40. vocatus atquo non vocatus, imitated from Greek, e.g. Thucyd.
1. 118 where Apollo promises to assist the Athenians καὶ παρακαλού-
μενος καὶ ἄκλητος. audit with non vocatus is an oxymoron, bringing
out the watchfulness of Oreus.

Ode ΧΙΧ.

Scheme. I have seen Bacchus teaching the nymphs and Satyrs.
My heart still throbs with an excitement that is almost more than I can
bear. The god inspires me and Ι can sing of his miracles, his exploits
in war, his power over the satellites of death.

The ode is, to some degree, imitated from a Greek dithyramb, a
hysterical song in praise of Bacchus. (cf. 111. 25 and the latter half of
1. 18.) The details of the miracles performed by Bacchus seem to be
taken from the Bacchae of Euripides.

Metre. Alcaic.

1. remotis, ‘secluded,’ like separatis in l. 18.

rupibus, ‘ a gorge,’ valley shut in by precipitous cliffs.

α. vidi, ‘I have just seen.' A picture ‚of Bacchus teaching the
nymphs and satyrs has been found on an ancient vase.

credite posteri, cf. posteri negabitis in Epod. 9. 11.

4. oapi-lpedum, ‘ goat-root ’ (used by Tennyson). Roman poets
confused the Satyrs with the Pans and the Fauni, to whom the goat’s
feet properly belonged. Satyrs are represented in Greek art as of
human shape, though they have little horus, sharp-pointed ears and
short tails.

acutas, ‘ pricked-up‚’ so that the points became conspicuous.

5. euhoe, in Greek εὐοῖ, the cry of the Bacchanals. Cf. 1. 18. 9.
Horace could not see the god without catching something of the
Bacchic frenzy.

6. pleno Bacchi pectore, abl. abs. Cf. 111. 2 5. 1 quo me, Bacche,
rapis tui Plenum? The same metaphor is seen in the Greek ἔνθεος
