onyx elic-id cadum. Cf. also 1. 31. 12 n. Horace wants to know by
what contribution he may earn his wine and is answered ‘ with a song.’

The song begins at 1. 9.
6. qnia aquam temperet. The scholiast Acron says that Greek

vines were drunk with warm water. The weather too was cold. See
the remarks on caldarium in Becker’s Gallus, Excursus Ν. to Scene

7. qno praebente domum, cf. Sat. 1. 5. 38 Murena praebente
domum, Capitone culinam, referring to an occasion when Horace, on a

8. Mimo. The country of the Paeligni, between Corfinium
end Sulmo, lay high and was very cold. ⁶ Paelignian cold’ seems to
have been as proverbial as ‘Scotch mists' with us.

The answers to these questions are suppressed‚ but it appears from
the next lines that the feast was to be on the first of the month (or on the
New Year's Day) and at Murena’s, and probably was to celebrate
Murena’s election to the college of augurs. The answer to the question

ἵζευ inquam etc. would seem to be ‘ Telephus‚' who is named towards

12. miscentur. The three toasts just called were apparently drunk
in merant, unmixed wine, according to the Greek practice. Two bowls
of wine and water are then prepared, one mixed inthe proportion of
three cyathi to the sextarius (ne. three parts wine to nine of water), the
other of nine cyathi to the sextarius (nine parts wine to three of water).
1t is possible, however, that cyathis may be a descriptive abl. with

la: ‘cups of three cyathi (ladles) or of nine are mixed,’ the reference
ἦ to the size of the draughts, not the proportions of the mixture,
wi this interpretation, however, the meaning of nnis-centur is sluraed,
sor the wine was not mixed in the cups but in the cratera.
