NOTES. 225

wilds, may 1 spend my declining years at Tibur or, if not there, at
Tarentum, whither the rich soil and the warrn winters attract me.
Come there with me and you shall attend my death-bed.

The idea that the ode is playful, not pathetic‚ is developed in the
notes on 11. 7, 21 and 2 3. It is observable that a similar ode of Catullus
(11, beginning Furi et Aureli, comites Catulli) is certainly comic.

2. cantabrum. The Cantabri were a turbulent and savage tribe
of N. Spain, who caused the Romans much trouble from 13.c. 29 to
mc. 19 when Agrippa finally conquered them. Cf. 111. 8. 22 and 1v.

7. modun, ‘end,’ ‘limit.’ Cf. Ι. 16. 2 and rapacis Orci fine in 11.

too might perhaps govern a gen. fisessi rerum in Aeneid 1. 178.

luo. Some edd. take this seriously‚ as if Horace were ill and
depressed and looked sorward to an early death. But there are good
reasons for thinking that the poem is merely playful, intended to mock
the extravagant schemes of Septimius. Put shortly, the argument is as
follows: ‘Septimius, you would follow me to Gades or the Cantabri or
Syrtes: but the journey to Tibur (a few miles) is quite enough of'
travelling and campaigning for me, sor Ι am sick of them.' It is to be
remembered that Horace was, at the time when this ode was published,
only 4¹ (see lutrod. p. xvii) and still far from senecta. The only dates
when he was really weary of travelling and fighting were in 13.C. 41
after Philippi and perhaps in B.c. 31 after Actium (Introd. p. xiii). 1f
the ode had been written at either date, the allusion to senecta and

Cantabri were in rebellion. Septimius, who wanted to see some
military service (Epist. 1. 9), had very likely asked Horace to join the
expedition into Spain and to take him as a eompanion.

ιο. pomti- ovlbun, dative after dulce. pellitis means ‘clad in
skins) Varro (de R. R. 11. 2) states that the shee of Tarentum and

Attica were so clad to keep their fleeces clean. olumella speaks of
Tarentine sheep as oves tectae.
