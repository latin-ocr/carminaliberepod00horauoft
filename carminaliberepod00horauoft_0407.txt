EPODES.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

THE Epodes appear to have been written at intervals between
mc. 40 and 31: at least, nos. 7 and 16 are plausibly assigned to the
former date: no. 17 distinctly refers (see lines 47, 58, 77) to Sat. 1. 8
which was written about B.c. 35: and nos. r and 9 were obviously
written within a very short time of the battle of Actium. We gather
from no. 14 that Hor. was with difficulty persuaded to collect them for

blimtion. ⁵ ,
pu It is supposed that they were published in B.c. 30, under the title
lambi (cf. Epod. 14. 7: Carm. 1. 16. 3, 24: Epist. 1. 19. 25), a name
which would suggest that Hor. was here imitating the famous Archi-
lochus of Paros (3.0. 7οο). Certainly, nearly all the metres of the
Epodes are borrowed from Archilochus, but the ἰαμβοί of the Greek

were lampoons‚ whereas only a few Epodes (nos. 4, 6, 8, 10) could
⁰ ly be so described. Hor. himself describes his obligations in the
following terms (Epist. 1. 19. 25):
Parios ego primus iambos
Ostendi Latio, numeros animosque secutus
Archilochi, non res et agentia verba Lycamben.

Probably the indignant or satirical Epodes, which most recalled
Archilochus, were the earliest written and Hor. subsequently adapted
the same metres to other themes. Two Epodes, nos. 5 and 17, seem to
be imitations of μιμιαμβοί, little dialogues of which some specimens, b
Herondas, have lately been discovered. The chief writer of suc
