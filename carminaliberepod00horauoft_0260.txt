216 HORACE, omes 11. i, ii.

removed its objects of worship to Rome. See the case of Veii in
Livy v. 22. Servius (on Aeneid xn- 841) says that, in the Third Punic
War, Scipio transferred a statue of Juno from Carthage to Rome.

27. victorum nepotes. Commentators cite this notable instance.
Q. Metellus Scipio, the' grandson of Q. Metellus Numidicus who

Ἣιιτςιιετεᾶ Jugurtha, killed himself in Africa after the battle of
apsus.

28. rettulit, re· in comp. often has the sense of ‘duly,' cf. redde
Iovi dapem in 11. 7. 17.

Iugurthae. Jugurtha was starved to death in prison 13.c. 104.

291 Two questions are ingeniously combined. ‘ WhatAplain is not
enriched with our blood and does not, by its tombs, bear witness to our
impious battles ?'

3ο. impia, because fratricidal.

31. Medis. The Parthians, as in 1. 2. 51, named here both
because they were very remote from Italy and also because they were
implacable enemies of Rome and would exult in her disasters‚

32. Hesperiae (adjective), ‘Italiam’ but its etymological sense is
‘ western ’ so that it contr-asts sorcibly with Medis.

33. gurges appears to mean ‘strait,’ the allusion being to the
naval battles of B.c. 36 in or near the straits os Messina, and to the

battle of Actium. The word gurges is sometimes applied to an open
sea (as Carpathius gurges in Verg. Georg. lv. 387), but the name is
appropriate to a strait with its violent currents, and we require some
distinction between qui gurges and quod mare of 1. 34.

34. Dauniae, properly ‘ Apulian' (cf. 1. 2ο. 14), but here ‘ Italian ’
(by metonymy of ‘ part for whole ').

37. ne retractes, ‘lest you should resume‚’ probably not prohibi-
tive but cf. 1. 33. ι n. ·

38. Ceae neniae, ‘the Cean dirge,' alluding to the dirges (θρῆνοι)
composed by Simonides of Ceos, a contem orary of Pindar (say
Rc. 520-450). Perhaps ‘we should translate as Kiessling suggests)

‘ the Cean dirge-goddess‚’ for there was a goddess Nenia at Rome, who
had a shrine before the Viminal gate-

munera, ‘the office ' (as supra l. 1 1) abandoned by Simonides.

39. Dionaeo sub antro, ‘in the grotto of Venus.’ Dione was the
mother of Venus.

40. leviore plectro, cf. maiore plectro in ιν. 2. 33. The abl.
belongs to quaere: ‘seek your tunes with lighter quill? The lighter
