176 HORACE, oDEs 1. xiv, xv.

sense occupo usually has the infin. as in 11. 12. 28 and Livy 1. 14 -
251⁶&ssss lssssllzgm facere. The corresponding Greek would be φθάνειν

4. nudum, sc. sit. For the abl. cf. Ι. ιο. ιι note, and nudus agris,
nudus nummis in Sat. 11. 3. 184.

6. gemant is dependent on vides, which (by the figure called
zeugma) means ‘ you see' with the first two dependent clauses and ‘you
perceive’ with the third. So audis in 111. 10. 5 means first ‘you hear’

and then ‘you perceive.’ The stoek example of zeugma (or combina-

tion of meanings) in English is Pope’s ‘ See Pan with flocks, with fruits
Pomona erowned.’

funibus. In Greek ὑποζώματα, ropes which were passed round
a ship, not under the keel but from stem to stern and back again. (See
Torr's Ancient Shz'ps p. 42). The operation is mentioned in Acts xxvii.
17, where ὑποζωννύντες τὸ πλοῖον is wrongly translated ‘ undergirding.'

7. durare, ‘to withstand‚' ef. Aeneid V111. 577 durare laborem.

carinae, ‘the hull·timbers.’ It would seem that carina is properly

not the keel, but the hull of a ship; for the word is applied to the shell
of a nut or a mussel.

8. imperiosius, ‘too masterful.'

ιο. dl. Images of protecting gods were placed on the stern of the
vessel. Cf. Ovid Her. 16. 112 accipit et pictos puppis adunca deos, and

Aeneid x. 171 aurato fulgebat Apolline puppis. In many ships os the
Mediterranean an image of the Virgin is still carried.

ιι. Pontica pinus. The forests of Pontus furnished much timber

for ship-building. Catullus’s yacht (the phaselus of Cat. 4) was made
from Pontic timber.

¹4· ml...flu1t, ‘the sailor, in the hour of danger, trusts not to gaudy
ships’ (but to stout ones).

16. debes ludibrium, ‘unless you have promised to make sport for

the winds‚’ i.e. unless you deliberately wish to court danger. For the
expression cf. Greek γέλωτα. ὀφλισκάνειν.

eave, ‘be careful.’ Cf. Epod. 6. ιι.

17—20. The allegory of a ship battling with a storm is here entirely

dropped, perhaps because the Greek poem, which Horace was imitafing,
went no further. This last stanza is merely advice to the ship of state
to avoid dangerous places.

nuper. Horace doubtless refers to the time when he was a political
partisan of Brutus (Introd. pp. xi, xii).

sollicitum taedium, ⁴ a gnawing discontent.’
18. desider-lum, ‘ a yearning’ (i.e. object os yearning).

20. cycladaS, gov. by inter of interfusa. Cf. Tac. Ann. 11. 9
flumen Visurgis Romanos interfluebat.
