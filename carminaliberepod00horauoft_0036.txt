g 6. Order os the Odes.

Though there is some reason to suspect slight interpolations
in the Odes (see below, p. xxxiv), there is no reason for doubting
that the present arrangement of the poems is substantially that
of Horace himself. But the order is clearly not chronological:
e.g. Ι. 24 was written in Rc. 24, while 111. 1—6 were written in
13.C. 27. Nor are poems of one kind, either in subject or metre,
placed together, for (e.g.) political poems and Alcaic odes occur
in all parts of the collection.

But we can often discern special reasons for placing single
odes or groups of odes in particular places. Thus 1. 1, 11. 20,
111. 29 and 30, lv. 1, are obviously appropriate to their places:
the six great odes at the beginning of Book 111. form a definite
cycle, and it is not an accident that the first niue odes of Book
1. are specimens of nearly all the metres that Horace attempted,
or that the first three odes are addressed to MaecenaS‚ Augustus
and Vergil.

In regard to the bulk of the poems, however, it is likely that
Horace deliberately threw them into some confusion in order to
favour that appearance of inspiration and unpremeditatedness
which, as was noticed above (p. xx), was one of the conventions
of lyrical composition. His Muse, he would have us believe,
was a whimsical lady, but we may say of her, as Congreve said
of Fair Amoret,

“Careless she is with artful care,
Affecting to seem unaffected.”

One noticeable device sor securing this effect was to place in
juxtaposition odes written in different moods, the grave with the
gay, the lively with the severe (e.g. Ι. 12 and 13, 24 and 2 5, 37 and
38: 11. 3 and 4: 111. 6 and 7). Another is to pretend that the
casual thought of one ode suggested the whole theme of the
next, as the mention of Fortune in 1. 34 suggests 1. 35, and the
mention of a holiday in ΙΙΙ. 17 suggests 111. 18. Contrasts of
subject too are not infrequent, as where in 11. 6 and 7 the quiet
