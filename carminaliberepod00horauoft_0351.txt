NOTES. 307

Τδε ode contains many of the same thoughts as 111. 1 and 111. 6,
and must have been written like them (and probably before thern) in

anticipation of Augustus’ reforms.
Μαι-ε. Third-Asclepiad.

. ι. intuens, ‘untouched,’ i.e. unrifled.
ο. thauma Arabum, cf. 1. 29. 1 beatis Arabum gazis. ⁷

3. menna, cf. 111. 1. 35.

4. *tyri-mum omne. The point of omne appears to be that the
rich man builds villa after villa, further and further in the sm, in the
hope of escaping anxiety and death. ι

5—8. ⁸1 figit...oa1mt. In this passage it is commonly assumed
that si figit is the condition of which expedzes is the apodosis. The
following (with some differences as to summis verticibus) is the accepted
version: ‘Yet if ⁶ Necessity drives her adamantine nails into [thy
house-to ], thou t not free thy soul from fear nor thy neck from the
noose o death! There are editors who take summis verticibus (1) of
the neiis, ‘up to their heads‘: (α) of the heads that tower hi hest (cf.
ιιι. 16. ις), i.e. the most conspicuous rnen: (3) of the head plur. sor
sing.) of the proprietor of the marine villa. For the last two versions,
the best authority is an Etruscan mirror, on the back of which Meleager
is drawn hunting the Calydonian boat and Atropos is driving a nail
into the boar'z head. But in 1. 3 5. 18 saeva Necessitas is pictured carry·
ing clavos trabales, ‘nails for boems,' and wedges and other builders’
tools. It is probable therefore that summis verticibus means (as it often*
does) the ⁴ house-top‚’ the points of the gables.

In effect, on this theory, the passage means: ‘ If Necessity sets-her
mark, you are bound to die? In any case, this is the flattest of truisms,
and we should rather expect si figet or si fixerit. It is better, with
Nauck and Kiessling, to take 5i=siquidem (as in 111. ι. 4¹) and translate
‘since Necessity drives her nails into thy house-top) Α

The passage, however, remains very obscure, for there seems little
connexion between the nail of Necessity and the noose of death.
Honoe’s imagery, however, is often confused (eg. 1. 35,111. 20, Epod. 6)
and the connexion of the hammer and nail with Death is abundantly
illustr-ared by monuments. There is, for instance, in the British Museum,
an Etruscan temple-shaped sarcophagus on one side of which is carved
a goddess (said to be Nortia) with hammer and nail, and on the other a

§zifzisstperbe Mantu or Charun) with a hammer. (See Fabretti Gloss.

5. aaz. For the long final cf. perrupit Acheronta in 1. 3. 36.

8. lnam, the noose of a snare. Cf. Psalms xviii. 5 ‘The
wgtegmgg, cords) of hell compassed me about: the suares of death

9. mnne-tren, ⁴ nomad‚’ cf. campi in 11. 20. 16,
