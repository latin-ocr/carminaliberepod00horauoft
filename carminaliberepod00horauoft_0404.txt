17. producas,‘ rear’ to mature years: cf. 11. 13. 3.

18. patrum decreta. The allusion is to the Lex Iulia de mari-
tandis ordinibus, which was sanctioned by a senatus consultum, but
rejected by the comitia, in B.c.18. It was carried later, but when, and
with what alterations, cannot be determined.1t imposed penalties on
celibacy and gave rewards to the parents of a numerous progeny.

19. prolis feraci, cf. fertilis frugum 1. 29.
20. lege marita, ef. maritum foedus Ovid ex P. 111. 1. 23.

21. per annos, ‘every 110 year5,' as per autumnos ‘every autumn’

H. 134. 32frequentis, emphatic, ‘attended by a mighty throng.’ of
course, if the population diminished, the ludi could not be frequentes.

25. veraces coemisse: in effect, ‘you who have always prophesied
‘ the truth‚ prophesy now good fortune equal to the past!

26. quod semel dietum etc., ‘that which, once pronounced, 011
immovable landmark preserves for ever) For semel‘ once for all' cf.
Ι. 24 16, 1. 28. 16 010. For terminus ef. Aen. lv. 614 et sic fata Iovis
poscunt, hic terminus haeret. For the subj. servet cf. 1. 32. 2, 3 si quid
—Lusimus tecum quod et hunc in annum Vivat. For per aevum
Bentley quotes, among many other passages, Lucr. 1. 549 servata per
aevum. The ordinary reading quod semel dictum est stabilisque rerum
Terminus servet is generally interpreted: ‘As once an'd for aye has been
promised—and may Time' s irremovable landmark protect the promisel'

as if quod semel dictum est anticipated bona fata and Terminus servet
’ were a prayer. But it is unlikely that Horace left cecinisse without 011
object or that he allowed the cacophony of dictumst stabilisque, and
rerum terminus is almost incomprehensible. Moreover, if the Parcae
are veraces and the fate has been pronounced once for all, it seems
useless to add the special prayer terminus servet.

27. peractis, sc.fatis; cf. 1v. 14. 39.
29. 'renus was worshipped on the third night of the ludi.

30. spicea—corona. The reference is to the Ambarvalia, a rustic
festival held at the time when the sickle was first put into the harvest.
'The ears of corn first cut were made into a garland sor the image of
Ceres. See Tibullus 11. 1.

31. salubres and Iovis both belong to aquae and aurae. See 011
lectas—castos l. 6.
