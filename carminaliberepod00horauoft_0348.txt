304 HORACE, ODES 111. xxii, xxiii.

The Romans usually worshipped Juno in that capacity, but the sunc-
tions of the goddesses are confused (as by Catullus supra and in Carm-
Saec. 13, perhaps in 11. 12. 20 where see note).

3. ter vocata.. To call thrice was proper in all religious and
ceremonial invocations. To this day, when a Pope dies, those present
call on him thrice by name—a practice derived from Roman funerals.

leto, dat.

4. (ilva. triformis. She was Luna in heaven, Diana on earth,
Hecate in the infernal regions. It is possible, however, that the
allusion is only to her functions as Hecate, who was represented at

cross-roads (hence Trivia) by three statues placed back to back, each
with different attributes.

t {1⁰⁹ tua pinus esto. ‘Thine be the pine that overhangs my home-
s ea .

6. quam...donem. The subj. is final: ‘that l' may present it.’

per exactos annos, ‘ every completed year.’ For per in this sense
cf. per autumnos ‘every autumn ’ in 11. 14. 15. Also 11. 3. 6.

7. meditantis. The boat is young and his tusks only give
promise of the sidelong blow, like the horns of the kidling in 111. 13. 4.
It is odd that a boar should be sacrificed, for goddesses usually
received female victims. It would seem that, by the dedication of the
pine-tree, Diana became the Genius loci, or one of the Lares, to whom

a pig of either sex· might be offered. Cf. 111. 17. 15 (porcus bimenstris)
and 111. 23. 4 (avuta porca).

Ode xxm.

Scheme. If at the new moon, Phidyle, you offer your simple
prayers and sacrifices, your harvests and your fatlings will be sufficiently
protected. Greater victims are expected of pontifices, but not of you.
Phidyle is commonly supposed to have been the villica, or bailiff’s
wife, at Horace's farm. It would be her duty, as Cato expressly says
(de Re Rustica 143), to pay the needful honours to the Lares.

Metre. Alcaic.

1. caelo. dat.=ad caelum, as in Aeneid v. 451 it caelo clamor.
Cf. Ι. 28. 10 Orco demissum.

supinas, ‘upturned.' The ancients turned up the palms of the

hapds in prayer. Cf. Aeneid 11. 153 sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera
pa mas.

α. nascente luna.. The Lares were worshipped especially on the

Kalends. Propertius V. 3. 53 says raris adsueta Kalendis Vix aperit
clausos una puella Lares.

Phidyle, in Greek Φειδύλη meaning ‘ thrifty? ’

3. horna. fruge. ‘This year’s corn ' could only be offered in the
autumn and winter. Hence probably ture is an alternative, to be
offered in the earlier half of the year, and avida porca is a very occa-
sional treat. See on l. 20.
