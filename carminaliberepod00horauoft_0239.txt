riding the winged horse Pegasus, slew the Chimaera by shooting arrows
at it from above. Thus Pegasus had a most important share in the

exploit.

Ode xxvm.

Owing to the fact that Archytas is addressed in 1. 2 and a sailor in
1. 23, it was formerly supposed that this ode was a dialogue between
Archytas and the sailor. On this theory, the sailor must say lines 1-6‚
or 1-16 or 1-20. But if we assign to him 11. 1—6, then iudice te etc.
in l. 14 makes a Pythagorean philosopher of him} and if we assign to
him ll. 1-16 or 1-20, then in l. 23 Archytas asks for burial, though
it is clear from 1. 3 that he was sufficiently buried already.

But it is now a generally accepted doctrine that the ode is a mono·
logue, spoken by the ghost of a drowned man whose body is cast ashore
near the tomb of Archytas. The ghost first addresses Archytas and
then mlls to a passing sailor and aeks for burial.

Schme. Despite your astronomy andsoaring philosophy, Archytas,
a little dust imprisons you for ever. Well, Pelops died and Tithonus
too and Minos and your own master Pythagoras, though he thought
that the body alone perished. ln truth, soldiers and sailors, young and
old, we are all bound to die. I myself was drowned at sea. But hol
sailor! stay a moment and fling some sand on my body. So may a safe
voyage and great gains await you. But if you resuse me this little boon,
then may-the disaster that you deserv-e overtake you.

Archytas. There is extant a book of Archimedes, called the ψαμμλτης

naming very high numbers, such as would be required in counting thei
grains of a whole universe os sand- Archytas may have attempted “

about mc. 460-390. He took a rominent part in politics and was
also the greatest mathematician olphis day. Plato made his acquain-
