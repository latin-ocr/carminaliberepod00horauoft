NOTES. 289

30, 31. potuere, as Wickham points out, is used in two senses, the
first of physioel power, the second· of moral courage. ‘ What worse
ἔζεε affinga 3131 icilgf’ and ‘They had the heart to slay their husbands

33. una de multis. A parallel to this expression occurs in the
lines which Ovid (Her. 14. 73) puts into the mouth of Hypermnestra:
Surge age, Belide, de tot modo fratribus unus ; Nox tibi, ni properas,
ista perennis erit.

35. splendide mendax. Among many parallels quoted by Orelli
for this oxymoron, the best and most famous is Antigone's description
of herself as ὅσια πανουῃήσασα (Soph. A nt. 74).

37. surge, cf. Ovid quoted at 1. 33.

38. unde, ‘from a hand that you do not suspect.' For unde used
of persons cf. 1. 12. 17, 1. 28. 28.

40. hue, ‘escape.’
4²· ungulos meram. The expression is appropriate rather to
the lionaesoe than to the brides. ‘They, like lionesses that have caught

a herd of calves, are slaughtering—woe is me—each her own victim.'
For the confusion of language cf. Postgate on Lucan vn. 125.

45, 47. mo, emphatic. ‘As for me‚’ I can endure chains or exile.

46. clemens mium. For contrasted adjectives placed together cf.
fragilem truci in 1. 3. ιο, or captivae dominum in 11. 4. 6.

Lib47. Iamidarum. Danaus, though king of Argos, was still king of
«ἴς. podo· et aurae, not alternatives: Lynceus is to hasten on soot
to the coast (from Argos) and then take ship.

. 51. m morem, cf. ΙΙΙ. 27. 14 et memor nostri, Galatea,
mmgbnloeo,“on my tomb,’ doubtless a cenotaph to be erected by her
grateful husband in a distant land.

5²· numnam, ‘an elegy.’ Ovid (Her. 14. 128) makes Hyper·
mnestra est her own epitaph:
s235³·th Hypermnestra, pretium pietatis iniquum,
Quam mortem fratri depulit, ipsa tulit.
Orelli metations the interesting fact that a Roman lady, visiting Egypt
in the time of Trajan, inscribed these lines on the pyramid of Gizeh:
Vidi pyramidas sine te, dulcissime frater,
Et tibi quod potui lacrimas hic maesta profudi.

Et nostri memorem luctus hanc sculpo querelam.
(C. Ι. L. ιιι. ρ. 8, no. 21.)

Ode ΧΙΙ.

Α monologue os a poor girl, Neobule, who is in love with Hebrus,
the young, the beautiful, the brave, and can neither show her love nor
drown it in wine nor go about her household duties.

The ode is imitated from one by Alcaeus in the same mette.
