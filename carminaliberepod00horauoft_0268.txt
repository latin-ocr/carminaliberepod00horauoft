and fruits motley: so that varius is nearly equivalent to ‘ variegating.'
(Cf. Introd. p. xxiv.) Some editors wish to take variuspuspureo colore

which are both in unemphatic positions.

distinguet means ‘ will set them off ' against the leaves.
’ lividos by itsels would mean ‘dark·blue,’ but here means only
‘dark,’ the specific colour being given by purpureo. Cf. Verg. Georg.
lv. 274 violae purpura nigrae.

13. lam te sequetur. The metaphor of the iuvenca is resumed, as
is shown by proterva fronte in l. 15.

ferox aem, ‘ headstrong time! Many edd. think it means ⁴ her
geyassitezoung age,’ but aetas must mean ‘time’ as nom. to apponet and

14. dempserit...apponet. An illogical metaphor from the phases
of the moon. The days themselves were regarded as added to the
waxing moon and deducted from the waning moon. (Hence in Greece

Pholoe, mentioned also in 1. 33. 9 and 111. 15. 7 (here along with
Chloris). She was apparently not one of Horace's flames, nor was
Chloris, so that he is probably not the middle-aged lover of Lalage.

fugax, ‘ froward.’
19. pura, ‘unclouded.’ Cf. solepuro 111. 29. 45.

renidet, ‘shines reflected.’
22. mire sagacis, a sort of superlative, ‘the shrewdest visitors.'

falleret, ‘ would escape,’ ‘ would be unnoticed by’ (1. 10. 16).

To Septimius, probably the same person for whom Horace wrote a
letter of introduction (Epist. 1. 9) to Tiberius and whom he describes as
fhrtem bonumque.
