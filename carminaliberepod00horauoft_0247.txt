ode ΧΧΧΙΙΙ.

To Albius, perhaps Tibullus the poet (died B-C. 18). The cruel
Glycera is, however, not mentioned by that name in any extant poem
of Tibullus. She is supposed to be identical with the lady called Neme-
sis in Tib. 11. 3. 4. The Albius addressed in Epist. 1. 4 was obviously

a rich man, whereas the poet Tibullus was poor. The identification is
therefore far from certain.

δώσει. Grieve no more, Albius, for the cruelty of Glycera and
leave off writing elegies on her perfidy. Lycoris loves Cyrus, and Cyrus

loves Pholoe, who loathes him. Such is the sport of Venus. I was a
victim to it myself at one time.

Πόνε. F ourth Asclepiad-

ι. m meu. Editors have generally regarded this as a final
elamet—‘In order that you may not grieve, I will tell you about
Lycoris and Cyrus-⁹ The reason given (also at 11. 1. 37 and 1v. 9. 1)
is that ' do not admit this form of prohibition, when
&mcum person, but require ne with perf. subj. or noli
with infin. Thus Roby says (ὅ 1600 n.) ⁴ In prohibitions to a definite
pam, the present subjunctive active is found occasionally in comic

poen: once m Horace (Sat. 11. 3. 88), once only in Cicero,' etc. But
uf the munies collected by Prof. H. C. Elmer (in American Journ. qf

m xv. 133) can be trusted, the rule is quite misconceived. In
‘ Latin prose (Cicero to Livy) a general prohibition of the form
ne sacia is exceedingly rare. In personal prohibitions, noli facere or
uusado or cau sacen& are the commonest forms: ne facias not at all
uncommon and nedfecens very uncommon (only occurring seven times, all
in Cicero). The ifference (according to Prof. Elmer) between ne ficeris
amanili} is that the former is peremptory and passionate, the latter
po te.

· 11 this* is the practice of the prose-writers, there need be no hesita-
uoo about constructing ne doleas here as a prohibition: ‘ do not grieve.’

nmmo, with doleas. cf.1.18.15 n.

ο. m Seeon 1. 19.

. 3. Gom. decantare is ‘to sing to the very end’ and so ‘ to
ung tetliously.⁸

σιτ, ‘ulting why) Cf, Epist. 1. 8. ιο irascar amicis Cur me funesto
proprus arcere van-no.

⁴· munt, ⁴ outshinoe you’ in Glycera's eyes.

5· tuni mnu, ⁸ with low sorehead! The Romans liked the hair

&awai that only a narrow space of sorehead was seen between the
e eyebrom. Cf. Epa-rt. 1. 7. 26 napos angusta fronte capillos.
