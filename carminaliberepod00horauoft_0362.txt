318 HORACE, onEs 111. xxix.

and besides, the dog-days are at hand. Your thought is ever on
polines, yet who can forecast the future? Take the pleasures that
to-day offers: to-morrow can never rob you of them. F ortune may
withdraw her savours‚ but if she does, I bear the change with
philosophie calm. Storms cannot appal me, for 1 have no wealth to

lose. (Dryden wrote a noble paraphrase of this poem, but his title
gives a wrong reference to 1. 29 >

The ode is placed here 111 order that Hor. may end, as he began
(1. 1), by inviting the patronage of Maecenas. The next ode is
merely a brief epilogue (cf. Introd. p. xvi) announcing that, with this
volume, Hor. brought his lyrical compositions to a close.

cThe allusions to Maecenas’ political cares perhaps point to the year

(see 111. 8), but it is possible that Maecenas was in charge of

Italy {iuring Augustus’s absence in Spain (Β. c. 27-24). See also the

note on 1. 27· The philosophy inculcated has been preached many
times before: e.g. 1.11 and 31, 11. 3, 11 and 16.

1. Tyrrhena regum progenies, ‘offspring of Etruscan kings.’ Cf.
1. 1. 1 Maecenas atavis edite regibus. The Cilnii are said to have been

tilted when the wine was poured into the cratera.

4. balanuszmyrobalanus, an Arabian nut from which a fragrant

precious and Hor. kept his best for Maecenas.

5. 60815. For the sing. with two noms. <merum and balanus) cf. 111.
3. 10, . 10 etc.

6. ne contempleris is regarded by most edd. as a clause, ‘so that
you rnay not gaze for ever on’ etc. But ne contempleris is a quite
permissible form of prohibition. See note on 1. 33. 1.

7. contempleris. Maecenas lived on the very top of the Esquiline,
and his house commanded a fine view. From it Nero looked on while
Rome was burning (Suet. Nero 38).

udum Tibur, wet with the many channels of the Anio and the spray
of the falls. Cf. 1. 7. 13.

any single English word expresses. It implies neatness and frugality
combined. Cf. Sat. 11. 2. 65 mundus erit qui non qffendet sor dibus
