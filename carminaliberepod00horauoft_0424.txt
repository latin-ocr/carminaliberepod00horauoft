380 HORACE, EPoDES rx, x.

canentes Caesarem, i.e. calling ‘ Caesar’ as their war-cry, cs. Aen.
v11. 698 ibant aequati numero regemque canebant.

19. portu, obviously the Ambracian gulf.

2ο. citae, pass. part. ‘moved.' As puppes, with navium, must
mean ‘sterns,' it is conjectured that puppim ciere means ‘to back water.’

sinistrorsum means ‘to our left,' i.e. away from the Roman fleet which
lay facing southward, with the gulf on its left. (Orelli, who thinks
sinistrorsum means ‘their left‚’ would translate ‘the enemy’s ships,
summoned to their left, i.e. out to sea, skulk in the harbour.’ This
version ignores puppes and strains the meaning of citae.)

f ἒ 1. io triumphe, the proper shout of welcome to the triumph-god ε
c . . ιν. 2. 49.

tu is emphatic and addressed to the god. Impatient for the final
stroke, Hor. eries ‘Why is the gilded car not here and the triumphal
victims? Is it thou that delays thern?' The meaning is ‘the victory
is ours: why dost thou not give it to us openly ?'

22. intactae, ‘untouched by the yoke’: cf. Aen. v1. 38 grege de
intacto mactare iuvencos. White unbroken cattle were sacrificed by the
triumphant general to Jupiter Capitolinus.

24. ducem, C. Marius, who celebrated a triumph for his victory

over Jugurtha on Jan. 1, 104 B.c. Sallust had lately revived the
memory of the war.

25. cul. The construction is neque (eo bello) cui Africani virtus
s. C. sepulcrum condidit. For the expression bello sepulcrum condere,

‘to end a war‚' Madvig compares Cic. de imp. Pomp. 30 bellum eius
adventu sublatum ac sepultum.

Those edd. who read Africanum, translate ‘sor whom his valour
built a monument on the ruins of Carthage.’ (With Africano the
construction is neque Africano bello illum ducem cui etc„ with the same
translation.) But sepulcrum means a tomb, not a monument, and
neither Scipio was buried at Carthage.

27. punico, for puniceo sc. sago, the red cloak, called paluda-
mentum, of the general.

28. lugubre sagum, ‘the cloak of mourning.' For the construction
of mutavit cf. C. 1. 17. 1 Lucretilem mutat Lycaeo Faunus, where also
the thing taken is in the accus„ the thing abandoned in the abl. instr.

²9· aut 1110 etc. The delay of Antony’s ships in coming out to

{lnept Agrippa's challenge raises a suspicion that Antony himself has
e .

centum...urb1bus‚ cf. C. 111. 27-332 centum...potentem oppidis

Creten. Hor. is translating Homer's epithet ἐκατόμπολις (Iliad 11. 349).
Cretam is governed by petit of 1. 31.

30. ventis non suls, i.e. alienis ‘unfavourable.' Cf. Ovid T rz‘st.
ΙΙΙ. 5. 4 nave mea vento forsan eunte suo.

31. Syrtis, the gulfs (not the adjoining deserts, as in C. 1. 2².- 5).
34. ema...1.esbia, sweet Greek wines.
