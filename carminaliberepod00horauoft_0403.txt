NOTES. 359

propheciae made in B.c. 76 to replace the books. Augustus, after
sisting thoee and rejecting many as spurious, deposited the remainder in
the temple of Apollo on the Palatine. They seem to have been all
written m Greek hexameters. (See Sibyllini libri in Smith’s Dict. of
Antiq. 3rd Ed.) The Sibylline verses on which the ritual of the Ludi
δαῖε. was founded, are given by Zosimus (as above cited). They begin
as ollows:

Ἀλλ’ ὁπόταν μήκιστος ἵκῃ χρόνος ἀνθρώποισι
Ζωῆς, εἰς ἐτέων ἑκατὸν δέκα κύκλον ὁδεύων,
Μέμνησ’, ὦ Ῥωμαῖε, καὶ οὐ μάλα. λήσεαι αὐτῶν
Μεμνῆσθαι τάδε πάντα κ.τ. λ.

Ifthese lines are genuine, it seems strange that there should have been
any dispute as to the duration of a saeculum.

6. virgines leem etc. There were 27 girls and 27 boys. This
number (ter noveni) appears to have been usual in Roman choruses:
Livy xxvu. 37 and xxxx. 12.

bem—custos. Each epithet belongs to both boys and girls (cf.
111. 4. 18, 19). They were to be children of parents religiously married
(confarreati), of patrician or at least senatorial rank, and patrimi et
matrimi (i. e. having both parents living, ἀμφιθαλεῖς).

7. neptem eones. The original Septimontium was confined to
certain spots on the Palatine, Esquiline and Caelian. By the septem
colles Horace doubtless means the whole city, including the Capitol,
Palatine, Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Viminal and Quirinal.

9. alme sol etc. Wickham suggests that the connexion between
the description and the prayer is ‘Unchangeable yourself, though you
Ξειιεὲἑὶὲεξξὲ ωᾶεῇεἰὲιιὶἑιέξὴεηςε, give to the pre-eminence of Rome

13. rite. ‘Thou whose kind office it is to bring children to birth
in due time) rite=‘aster thine office’ (Wickham): cf. Aen. 111. 36
nymphas venerabar agrestes...rite secundarent visus. aperire partus
seems to mean ‘to make the way easy for births.' For lenis aperire
cs. non lenis recludere 1. 24. ¹7 and Introd. p. xxiii.

14. mtnyia. The goddess of birth, identified by the Greeks with
Artemis. Horace seems to identify her with Diana, who again was
sometimes identified with Juno Lucina: thus Catullus (34. 13) addresses
Diana as tu Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta puerpen's. In the ceremonies
os the Ludi Saeculares, however, sacrifice was offered on the second
night to the Ilithyiai. (Both the inscription cited in the Introd. and
Zosimus have the plural: the latter calls them κυανέας Εἰλειθυίας.)
These were two oddesses‚ daughters of Juno and in no way connected
witlti Diana. lforaoe apparently did not consult the XVviri before
vri mg.

16. Gemuit.. This title, whether os Juno or Diana, is not found
elsewhere, nor is there any Greek title exactly corresponding. To be
known by many names conferred glory on a divinity3 and Artemis, in a
hymn of Callimachus, expressly asks Zeus to give her πολυωνυμίηε cs. Sat.
