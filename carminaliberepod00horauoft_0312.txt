268 HORACE‚ oDEs 111. iv.

Ode Ν.

Scheme. Sing, Calliope, a longer strain. Ye Muses, ye have been
kind to me from childhood. Ye have saved my life often and I sear no
danger in your company. To Caesar, too, you bring a solace after toi]
and counsels gently administered. We know how Jupiter hurled
down the giants who tried to‘ scale Olympus· Force without discretiou
is always doomed to failure 3 so is force employed in impiety: as many
an ancient example shows.

The thoughts in this ode are unusually abrupt even for Horace, but
the main point seems to lie in lines 41 (vos lenc consilium et date} etc.)
and 65 (vis consili expers mole ruit sua), where it is suggested that the
success of Augustus in his gigantic combats was due to the consilium of
the Muses, meaning no doubt Maecenas and other persons of literary
tastes. They were to Augustus what Pallas and Apollo were to
Jupiter in the war with the giants. The tendency of their advice
would naturally be towards leniency, but it is pressing the words lene
consilium too much to interpret them as ‘ counsels of mercy’ and to
make them the keynote of the ode, as Mommsen does. It is sufficient
if we see in the ode a commendation of Augustus for choosing his
⁴ advisers among men of peace, and for attaching literary men to his
court.

1. descende caelo, ‘come down from thy home in heaven‚’ or
perhaps (as Porphyrion suggests) ‘leave the subject of the gods’: desine
rejfcrre sermones deorum.

1, 3, 4. tibia...voce...fl‹flbuz. Wickham sees here only two alter-
natives: viz. a high voice with accompaniment of the tibia, or a low
voice with accompaniment of the lyre. But it is much simpler to
suppose that there are three alternatives, viz. a choral ode with tibia, a
song without accompaniment, or a song with lyre. The poet is not
particular as to the choice of the strain, provided it be long.

tima, cf. 1. 12. 1, 2. The pipe was the proper accompaniment of
choral odes: the lyre of songs. See Intr'od. p. xviii and 1. 1. 32—34 n.

α. regina. Calliope is called, in Hesiod's T heogony 79, the noblest
ogtaglmthgf Ιέἱιὲεῗέῃξὲ ,Horace appears to mean only ‘my queen,' not

calliope. She was, to later writers, the muse of Epic poetry, but
it is evident that Horace laid no stress on such distinctions. In 1. 1.
33 he professes to be beholden to Euterpe (the lyric muse) or Poly-
hymnia (the muse of sacred songs): in 1. 12. 2 to Clio (the muse of
history): in 1v. 3. 1 to Melpomene (the muse of tragedy), and elsewhere
(1. 17. 14, 11. 1. 9, 111. 3. 70) to the Muse generally, without naming

' one in particular.

3. seu...seu. The sentence would in full be: dic longum melos

lvadl voc-eh sz‘ mavis, fidz‘busve, si mavis. There is a similar condensation
e ow . 21—24.
