250 HORACE, ODES 11. xviii.

8. trahunt, ‘ spin.’ honestae, probably ‘ well—born,’ the dignity of
the patron being enhanced by the respectability of his clients.

The purpurae seem to have been purple togas. It is clear that such
things were worn, for Augustus as early as 13.c. 36 (Dion Cassius XLIX.
16) issued a decree that none but magistrates and senators should wear
them. It is possible, however, that the purpurae are only the fringe of
the toga praetexta, worn by all curule magistrates.

9. fides, ‘ honesty.’

10. benigna vena, ‘ an abundant vein! dives vena is used in the
same connexion in Ars Poet. 409. vena generally means a vein of ore
in a mine, but Ovid uses it (also in connexion with ingenium) of a
spring or runlet.

est = adest mihi.
1 2. potentem ameum, Maecenas.

14. unicis Sabinis, ‘with only& my Sabine estate) Sabinis is
masculine, the name of the inhabitants being used sor the estate. The
idiom is not uncommon. Kiessling (after Lachmann and Haupt)
quotes Tusci grandine excussi from Pliny Epist. IV. 6: and Paelignos
videor celebrare salubres from Ovid Am. 11. 16. 37.

15, 16. These lines explain sub ipsum sunus of 1. 18, which is the
keynote of the rest of the ode. ‘Time is hurrying on and you, un-
mgisdtffflgcf’f the neamess of death, are intent on your building and land-
gr t15. trudltur dies dle. Cf. Epod. 17. 25 urget diem nox et dies
noc em. ·

17. secanda. locas, ‘you place contracts for cutting marble into
slabs.' The person who took the contract was called redemptor (111.
1. 35). The slabs were used for pavements and as lining for walls.

18. sub ipsum mnus. subss‘ just before‚' of time: as in sub
noctem.

ao. urges, ‘ you press on the work of advancing the shore!
summovere generally means ‘to shoulder out of the way ’ (as in 11. 16.
10), but here the sea is pushed away, so that summovere litora :promo-
vere litora, ‘to push forward the shore.’ Villas were frequently built
half in the sea, so that the owner might fish out of window. Cf. 111.
1. 33 and 111· 24, 4.

22. parum locuples, ‘ not rich enough in land so long as the beach
confines you-⁹ continente ripa is abl. abs. Other edd. seem to take
ripa as dependent on locuples and continens as relating to the sea:
‘ not rich enough with the confining beach ' or ‘the beach of the main-
land’: but in these versions continente adds little to the meaning of ripa
(‘sea shore' as in 111. 27. 24). continente might mean ‘adjoining,’ as
in the Monumentum Ancyranum where Augustus declares that he had
built curiam et continens ei chalcidicum.

23. quid quod. ‘Nay, worse? Wickham.

proximos agi-1 terminoS, ‘your neighbour's land—marks.' The
terminus was a square stone set as a boundary-mark. To remove it
