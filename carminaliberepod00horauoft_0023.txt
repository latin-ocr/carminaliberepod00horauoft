INTRODUCTION. xix

Sappho or Anacreon wrote—songs intended to be sung by one
person in a private circlel.

The lyrics of Horace (though they were meant to be read or
recited, not sung) belong entirely in form, and usually in
substance, to the latter class. His metres are all borrowed
from the Greek song-writers, and his Muse, as he often says,
was inclined to be sportive (iocosa) rather than solemn 2. Even
in the Carmen Saeculare and in Carm. Ν. 6, which were
written for public performance by a chorus, he did not attempt
the grand Pindaric elaboration which, he confesses indeed
(Carm. 1v. 2. 25-32), was beyond him. Yet several of the
longer and graver odes (see especially 111. 3, 4, 5, 11, 27, lv. 4),
though still written in song—metres, are quite Pindaric in the
treatment of the theme. In 111. 3, for instance, the opening
truism‚ the illustrations from many myths‚ the elaborate inven-
tion of Juno's compact and the brief sententious close are all
clear imitations of Pindar3. The Pindaric tendency, here

the third to songs. Lyrical poetry intended for a chorus is sometimes
called melic-

⁸ The extant odes of Pindar are all ‘ epinikia‚' i.e. celebrations of
the vietorioe os certain persons in the great athletie contests of Greece.
The following summary of the F irst Olympian Ode will sufficiently
show Pindar's manner of treating a theme:

1—15. Water is the best drink: gold the choicest metalz so are
the Olympio games the noblest games.

15—38. Let us sing the praises of Hiero, the victor, who won
glory at Olympia, the home of Pelops.

38—55. Song ean give curreney to salsehoods, but we must not
:peak evil of deitioe.

56—85. Poseidon, of his great love, carried off Pelops. The tale
that Pelope was killed and eaten is a base invention.

86—150. Because of the misdeeds os his father Tantalus, Pelops
