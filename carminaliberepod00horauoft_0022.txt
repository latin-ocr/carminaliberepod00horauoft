xviii INTRODUCTION.

The date B.C. 22 was proposed by the late Prof. Sellar
because, in Epist. 1. 13, Horace, who was sending his odes to
Augustus, directs the messenger (one Vinnius Asina) to push
.on over hills, rivers and bogs, as is Augustus were far away at
the time. Prof. Sellar guessed that Augustus was in Sicily or
Asia, whither he went in B.C. 22. Itis just as likely, however,
that Augustus was at Gabii, undergoing the cold-water treat-
ment which cured him of a grave illness in B.C. 23.

(b) Τ lte Fourtlt Book. The fourth book of the Odes was
beyond question written some years after the first three. The
opening ode itself, the language of Epist. 1. 1. 1—-10, and the
express evidence of Suetonius (see p. xiv and n.) show that, after
the publication of the first three Books‚ Horace had meant to
abandon lyric composition, and only resumed it with reluctance.
In the first ode, Horace describes himself as near 50 years of
age. Odes 4 and 14 cannot have been written before the
winter of B.C. 15, for they celebrate the grand campaign of that
year in which Drusus conquered the Vindelici, Tiberius the
Raeti. Ode 5 must have been written about the same time, for
it complains of the long absence of AugustuS, who had gone to
Gaul in B.C. 16. Ode 2, perhaps, is a little later, for it was
written when Augustus seemed likely to return to Rome soon.
As a matter of fact, Augustus returned in July B.C. 13. It
seems probable therefore that the book was published in B.C. 14
or early in 13. (On the metrical peculiarities of Book lv. see
infra pp. xxviii, xxix and the first note to C. lv.)

5 3. Some Characterzlrtics of Horace’s Poetry.

The Odes of Horace are avowedly imitations of Greek
models: but there were Greek models of two quite different
kinds, and Horace sometimes imitated them both at the same
time. On the one hand, there were public odes, such as Pindar
(1320. 480) wrote—dithyrambs, paeans, songs of victory and
dirges—-solemn and elaborate compositionS, intended to be
sung by a trained chorus who danced or marched while they
sang. On the other hand, there were lyrics such as Alcaeus or
