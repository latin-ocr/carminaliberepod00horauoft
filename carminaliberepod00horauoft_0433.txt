NoTES. 389

46. fluam arborem, ‘its mother-tree,’ not a tree on which it is
grafted. Vergil, on the other hand, says of the grafted tree miraturque
novas frondes et non sua poma (Georg. 11. 82).

47—50. Cf. Tibullus 1. 3. 45 ipsae mella dabant quercus, ultroque
ferebant Obvia securis ubera lactis oves.

48. levis...ped0. Alliteration is not very common in Horace.
But cf. C. 1. 4. ¹3 pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, and lv. 4. 9, 10 venti
paventem mox in wilia Demisit hostem vividus impetus. ·

5ο. mens, ‘ sor love' (Wickham).

52. neque...humus. This curious expression, ‘ nor does the ground
swell up tau with vipers‚' seems to be a hypallage for ‘nor do vipers
swell up tau from the ground.’ Nauck quotes Ovid Met. 11. 854 colla
toris artant (for {glrt in collis exstant) and other instances, but they are
not so violent as ‘s.

53. ut, ‘how,’ as C. 111. 4. 17 and 4²·
55. neela glaebis, abl. abs.‚ ‘the clods all dry.’
56. numqua, ‘either extreme’ (Wickham), i.e. flood and drought.

62. impotentia, ‘uncontrollable fury': cf. Aquilo impotens C. 111.
Ξῧο1634. mnus aureum. Horace recognizoe only three ages, of gold,
of bronze and of iron. Other poets substitute silver for bronze, but

Οὖίᾶ (Metam. 1. 89-127) inserts a silver age before the bronze age.
mutauit, ‘ alloyed,’ changed to a darker colour.

65. aere. Many edd. read aerea dehinc, treating dehinc as a
monosyllable (cf. antehac C. 1. 37. 5). But the majority of MSS. have
aere, and dehinc is dissyllabic in Sat. 1. 3. 104, Epist. 11. 3. 144· Orelli
thinks the)repetition os aere is an imitation of Lueretius (e-g. Lucr. 111.
12, V. 950 .

amum, ‘ from which!
V XVII

This composition is not technically an Epode‚ for the lines are of
unisorm scansion (cf. ‚Introductory Note). It bears a close resemblance
to a Greek mime.

The subject is a dialogue between Horace (ll. 1-52) and Canidia
(11. 52-81). in which Horace confessas Canidia's power and offers to
make reparation sor all his abuse of her: Canidia, on the other hand,
insists on her revenge. By many ingenious turns, Horace contrives to

repeat, or to make Canidia repeat, the very worst charges that he can
bring against her.
