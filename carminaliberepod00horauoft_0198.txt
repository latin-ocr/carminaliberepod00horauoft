154 HORACE, oDEs 1. ii.

7. Proteus, a sea-god who kept the herd of seals belonging to
lgplseaeo3; 6 {lecti 1s described in Verg. Georg. lv. 429-43 5 and in Homer,

8. visere, see Introd. p. xxiii.
9. haesit, ‘was entangled.'

14. litore Etrusco, ‘from the shore of the Etruscan sea‚' as in C-S.

38 and Epod. 16. 40. It is sometimes interpreted ‘from the Etruscan
(i. e. the right) bank of the river.’

15. regis, sc. Numae.

monumenta...vest.ae. The temple of Vesta, the house of the Vestal
virgins and the regia, or house of the Pontifex Maximus, stood, adjoining
one another, on the west ‘side of the Via Sacra just at the point where
floods would break in. All these buildings were ascribed to Numa
Pompilius.

Julius Caesar lived in the regia, and there was undoubtedly a great
flood in the spring or winter of B.c. 44, the year when he was murdered.
It is not likely, however, that Hor. is alluding to this flood, which

happened when he was a student in Athens and long before he could
have written this ode.

17. niae, the supposed ancestress of the Iulia gens. She was the
,daughter of Aeneas and sister of Iulus. According to one legend, she
(and not Rea Silvia) was the mother of Romulus. After his birth, she
was flung into the Tiber (or the Anio, according to ovid), but the river-
god rescued her and made her his wife.

nmium, probably with se iactat (so Kiessling), though most edd.
take it with querenti. But Ilia has a right to complain loudly. It is
Tiber who shows unnecessary violence.

querenti, complaining of the murder of Julius Caesar.

18. lactat se Iliae, ‘vaunts himself in the eyes of Ilia as her
avenger! For the construction, cf. Ovid Her. xu. 175 stultae dum
te iactare maritae quaeris.

19. Iove 11011 probante. Porphyrion explains: quod terreri Iup-
piter populum iusserit, non perire.

19, 20. uxorius amn-is. Division of a word between the third and
fourth lines of a Sapphic stanza occurs also in 1. 2 5. 11 and in 11. 16. 7.
Sappho has it several times in the few extant specimens of her poetry,
and it seems clear that, in the original rhythm, the fourth line was
continuous with the third, so that the stanza consisted of three lines
only.

21. audiet...ferrum. The subject is iuventus in v. 24. The line is
commonly interpreted ‘will hear how citizens sharpened the sword
against each other,’ the sense being brought out partly by the emphasis
on cives and partly by the mention of a better purpose in the next line.
But a passage in Ovid (Metam. xv. 77 5) where Venus, pleading for the
life of Julius Caesar, says ‘en acui sceleratos cernitis ense5?’ suggests that
the allusion here is to the murder of Julius.
