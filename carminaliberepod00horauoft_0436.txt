50. venter, ‘ Pactumeius is the fruit of your womb.’ See 5. 5.

53. quid obseratis etc. Canidia‘s reply begins.

58. pontifex seems to mean what we should call ‘ a past master.’
In this sense antistes (which also means ‘high-priest’) is frequently

sorcery os Canidia on the Esquiline.

60. quia proderit etc. The text means ‘What use will it be to
you (Horace) to spend your money on Paelignian witches and to
concoct a swifter poison than mine?' Canidia seems to hear Horace
muttering over some plans to bring his torture to an end. The text,
however, is somewhat doubtful. There is good authority sor proderat,
making Canidia say ‘If I let you go, what use was it to spend my
money ’ etc.

62. tardiora. vous, ⁴ slower than you pray for!
63. in hoo, ‘for this purpose?

seems to threaten the waxen doll with tortures.

80. desideri...pocu1um, ‘ to brew a love-potion,' cf. 5. 38.
