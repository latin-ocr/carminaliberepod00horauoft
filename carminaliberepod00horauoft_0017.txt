INTRODUCTION. xiii

afterwards (3.0. 38)1 Maecenas invited him to join his circle,
and Horace’s fortune was made.

C. Cilnius Maecenas was now and for long afterwards the
right-hand man of Octavianus in all civil affairs, He was very
rich, very fond of literary'society, and very generous to literary
men. His patronage relieved Horace from poverty and from
anxiety about his social position, while it provided the necessary
stimulus to a poet who was naturally both lazy and fastidious.
The Subsequent life of Horace has only a few prominent inci-
dents. In the autumn of B.c. 38 he was one of a large party
who accompanied Maecenas to Brundisium2. In B.C. 35 he
published the first book of the Satires. Soon afterwards
Maecenas gratified his dearest wish by presenting him with the
small estate in the Sabine district-3, to which so many loving
allusions are made in Horace's works. It seems to have been

his habit, at least in later years, to spend the summer and -

autumn here4, the winter at Baiae or Velia or some other sea-
side resort, and only the spring at Rome⁵. 1t is likely that
Horace was present as a spectator at the battle of Actium in
Rc. 31⁶. In B.C. 30 he published the second book of the Satires
and, about the same time, the Epodes. About B.C. 23 he pub-
lished the first three books of the Odes together.

It is obvious, in these works, that the political opinions of
Horace had undergone a great change since he fought for the
republic at Philippi. By B.C. 31 he had learnt to exult in the

numero). The year is fixed by Sat. 11. 6. 40, 41, where Horace says
that it is nearly eight years since Maecenas me coepit habere suorum 1 in
numero. This satire was written at the end of B.c. 31.

valley of the Digentia, north of Tibur.
