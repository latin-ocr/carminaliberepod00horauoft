NOTES. 327

mvn. verba, ‘strange words) Long compound words were
especially appropriate to dithyrambs (Aristotle, Poet. 22. 14).

11. nameus lege solans, ‘wayward rhythms) A dithyramb was
not composed in a* set form os scansion, which might be called the lex
of the poem. For numeri cf. Cic. Or. 20. 67 quidquid est enim quod
sub aurium mensuram aliquam cadit, aiamsi abest a versu‚—-numerus
vocatur, qui Graece ῥυθμός dicitur.

13. reges, not the kings of Pindar’s day but the demigod kings of
the mythology, such as Pirithous who slew the Centaurs and Bellero-
phon who killed the Chimaera. The allusion is to Pindar’s hymns and

ωας.

games at Pisa in Elis.
18. uolatu, predicative. The palm brings them home exalted, cf.
1. 1. 5 palmaque nobilis Terrarum dominos evellit ad deos.

pugnamve equumve. The selection of boxing and chariot-racing (as
in xv, 3. 4) was perhaps suggested by Pollux and Castor (hunc equis,
illum superare pugnis nobilem 1. ιο.. 26). In equumve the horse implies
the ¹charioteer 3 cf. Homer’s ἵπποι τε καὶ ἀνέρες for ‘ charioteers and men
on oot.

¹9· nonore sig-ms. For the idea ef. 111. 30. 1 and 1v. 8 (where it
is expanded into a complete poem).

Μ. The -ve of iuvenemve is equivalent to sive, si being supplied
from the previous stanza, cf. Ars P. 63, 64.

nabin: ‘w ing,’ ‘tearsu1,’ just as in 11. 14. 6 z'llacn'mabilzts· meant
‘teau-less? ‘unab e to weep,' cf. flebilis Ino in Ars P. 123. The dative
doubtless belongs to plorat: ‘or if, for a weeping bride, he mourns her
lover snatched away! But raptum sponsae ‘torn from his bride' is a
possible construction.

υ. plorat. The reference is to Pindar’s θρῆνοι, dirges.

meroque. The last syllable is again elided. nigro is contrasted
with aureos. Those golden virtues are too bright for gloomy Orcus.

25. multa aura, ‘a full breeze‚' lit. plenty of breeze. Pliny uses
multus sol for ‘ plenty of sun.’

mm, from Dirce, a spring and streamlet near Thebes.
