NOTEs. 175

immodica moro, ‘rendered violent by wine?

12. mmmm notam, ‘a scar.'
13, 14. non...8p0ree. ‘You would not expect.’

perpetuum, ‘constant.’

16. quum. pam. This is probably to be translated literally.
Ibycus (fr. 33) had called honey ‘the ninth part of ambrosia,' and
another Greek lyrist had called it ‘the tenth part of irrimortality?
Horace therefore, in saying that Venus had steeped Lydia’s lips ‘ with
the fisth · of her nectar‚’ implies that the lips were far sweeter than
honey. elli, however, and other commentators see in quinta parte
an allusion to Aristotle’s πέμπῃ οὐσία (quinta essentia) the fifth and
highest and puroet element: as if quinta parte meant ‘ the fifth ingredi-
ευτ’ and so ‘the finaet essence!

17. mneos ter. This substitute for a superlative is common in

Greek (as τρισάθλιος, τρίσμακαρ). Verg. (Aen. 1. 94) has 0 terque

beati. W. von Humboldt suggested that the usage descended

a very early time when people could only count as far as 3 or 4.
(See Tylor's Primuive Culture, 1. p. 265.) .

18. noe· Observe that divuhus amoris really Latin for ‘a rupture

of their love,’ so that only one negative is required. Cf. 11. 4. 10

ademptus Hector ‘the death of Hector’ ε Epist. 1. 1. 26 quod neglectum

‘the neglect of which.’

το. suprema. anus dle. ‘ Sooner than the day of death (parts
them).’ Orelli and others think the construction is equivalent to citius
quam etna die, ⁴ sooner than on their dying day‚' the abl. thus doing
double uty, as abl. os time and also of comparison. But this is not
good sense, sor it is death, and not a rupture os love, that parts them

sumna die.
Ode ΧΝ.

sthene. Gain the harbour quickly, O ship. Your hull and your
{zecue are battered, and your claim to noble origin will not serve you in

The ode is undoubtedly imitated from one by Alcaeus (see Introd.
p. xxxviii) which is said to have been an allegorical address to Mytilene,
the city and its troubles being ty ified as a ship and a storm. Quintilian
(vm. 6. 4⁴) quotes this ode o Horace as a specimen of allegoria or
mo: ‘ut ‘⁸ Ο navis reserent...portum” totusque ille Horatii locus
quo navem pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro bellis civilibus,
ponunt pm pace atque concordia dicit.’ But, granted that there is a
general allegory, there are also many details which are not allegorical,
and which are suitable to a real ship but not to ‘the ship of state.'

Metre. The Fisth Asclepiad.

occupa· portum, ‘get first to harbour,' before the waves rive you
