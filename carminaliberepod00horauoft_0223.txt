NOTES. 179

Ode xw.

   

To a lady of whom the poet had previously said hard things. It

has been suggested that this lady was the Tyndaris who is invited to

⁸ Horace’ 5 farm in the next ode: or the Canidia who is so outrageously

ζ abnsed' m Epodes 5 and 17 and Sat. 1. 8. The poem is a palinode or

² ‘recantation’ (παλινῳδία) of the kind which Stesichorus wrote when he
withdrew his calumnies on Helen of Troy, cf. Epod. 17. 42—44.
Certainly the attacks on Canidia are written in iambics, and m Epod. 17
Horace offers to retract them, but ll. ‘xz—2 5 seem to show that Horace
is not now retracting any poem of his youth, such as the Epodes were.
The offence given was recent.

Scheme.1·'orgivefair lady, my scandalous lines. 1 wrote them
under the influence of anger, that frightful passion. We inherit it from
the savage lion, and much mischief it has caused to the world. When I
vas young, 1 gave way to anger, but now I wish to be mild and gentle.
