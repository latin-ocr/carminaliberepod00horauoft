368 HORACE, EPoDEs 11, 111.

tonantis Iovis, i.e. Juppiter Tonans. The epithet is not here
specially significant.

33. amite levi. The scansion is probably dmite le'vi, but ames does
not occur elsewhere in poetry and the quantity of the first syllable
is therefore doubtful. Festus explained the word to mean furcula seu
pertica aucztpalis, ‘a little fork or wand for bird-catching.'

rara retia, said to mean ‘wide-meshed nets‚’ as distinguished from
- those used for fishing. Hunting-nets were usually called plagae or
casses, but Vergil (Aen. ιν. 131) includes retia rara in the equipment of
a hunting-party.
34. dolos, ‘traps'

35. laqueo, contracted into a dissyllable, like Pompei of Carm.
gltid7}15·. αξη anapaest in the 5th foot is similarly avoided in 5. 79
advenam. The crane is a summer visitant in Italy.

37. majarum, sc. curarum. For the attraction of curas into the
subordinate clause, cf. Sat. 1. 4. 2 alii quorum comoedia prisca virorum esf.

amor seems to mean ‘ family love.' Cf. Cic. Part. Or. 25, 88 quoted
by Lewis and Short s. v, amor, and see next note. The money-lender
Alfius speaks as a confirmed old bachelor of selfish habits. A Dutch
scholar, P. Scdnerius, has proposed to read Roma quas, but what is

the point of obliviscitur? If a man forgets the demerit-s· of a thing, he
begins to hanker after it.

39. quodsi, ‘ but if‚’ as in ιο. 21 or Carm. 1. 1. 30. (The apodosis
begins at non me 1. 49.) The sequence of thought appears to be ‘ In
the country you forget the inconveniences of marriage and take a wife.

But if your wife is a good one, she can make you as comfortable as ever
you were in Rome.’

in partem, ἐν μέρει, ⁴ for her part.’ The expression is not certainly
found elsewhere, pro parte being more usual.

4²· pernicis, cf. impiger Ap ulus Carm. 111. 16. 26. For the
vigorous Sabine housewife cf. 111. . 40.

43. sacrum, sc. Laribus.

emat coordinate with iuvet of 1. 39. The fire is piled to cook
the food, heat water for the bath, dry wet clothes, etc.

45. cratibus, hurdles enclosing the sold.

47. dolio, the wooden cask, not an amphora. The epithet dulci
really characterises the wine.

49. Lucrina conchylia, probably the large mussel (called Lucrina
peloris in Sat. 11. 4. 38), obtained from the Lucrine lake.

50. rhombum ‘ turbot,’ so called from its shape.

scari, said to be a kind of wrasse or rockfish‚ though these are not

commonly considered good eating. Ennius called the scarus cerebrum
Iovis, from its delicious flavour.

51. intonata, ‘thundering‚’ apparently deponent. tonare, however,
is sometimes transitive.
