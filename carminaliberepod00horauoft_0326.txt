282 HORACE, ODES 111. viii.

Scheme. Do you ask the reason of all these preparations for
sacrifice? Know then that today, the rst of March, is the anniversary
of my escape from being crushed by a falling tree (see 11. 13). Come,
join me in a carouse. The affairs of state are not pressing now and you
can afford to take a holiday.

The date of the ode is not certain, B.c. 29, 26, 24 and 19 being
proposed by van‘ous editors and historians. The considerations urged
in the final note to 11. 9 make the last date highly improbable. It was
suggested in the Introd. to 11. 13 that the ode was written in March
B.c. 24, but March 13.c. 28 would suit it very well.

The allusions to foreign affairs can be explained by events of
B.C. 29. Early in that year, there was talk of the quarrels of Phraates
and Tiridates in Parthia: the Cantabri were conquered by Statilius
Taurus, the Daci and the Bastarnae, a Scythian people‚ by M. Crassus.
(Dion Cass. LI. 18, 20, 2 3). But there cannot have been any campaigns
so early in the year as March 1st and the whole tenour of the ode
suggests that Maecenas, though engaged in politics, was no longer
in office. The year 28 seems therefore more likely than 29 for the
composition of the poem.› (In March 13.c. 29 Maecenas was still
praefictus urbi in the absence of Octavian.)

r. Martfls Kalendis. The rst of March was the day of the
Matronalia, a festival in which no bachelor could reasonably be
supposed to take an interest.

5. docte sermones, for the accus. cf. 111. 9. 10 dulces docta modos.

semones, apparently means the λόγοι, myths and chronicles, ‘the

talk of the town.’ It clearly means more than ‘taught to converse in
Greek and Latin.’

utriusque linguae, Greek and Latin, as in Cic. de Off r. ι ut par
sis in utriusque orationis-facultate. The point is that Maecenas, though
he knows the lore of Greek and Latin festivals, cannot guess why
Horace is keeping a festival to-day.

6. voveram, ‘ Ι had vowed’ without your knowing anything about
it. Cf. laborabas in 1. 27. 19.

7. Libero, the inspirer of poesy. But in 11. 17. 28 Horace
attributes his safety to Faunus.

album caprum, a goat, because goats were supposed to injure vines
and were therefore offered to Bacchus (Vergil Georg. 11. 380): a white
one because Bacchus was one of the di superi.

funeratum ‘ done to death.’ funerari usually means ‘to bury?
8. arboris ictu. See 11. 13·

9. anno redeunte, ‘as the year comes round.’ The meaning is

that this is the first ·anniversary of the accident, not that the day was to
be a festival every year.
