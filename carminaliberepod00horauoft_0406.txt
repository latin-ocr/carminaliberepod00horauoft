362 HORACE, CARMEN SAECULARE.

66. felix probably applies equally to rem Rom. and Latium:
‘prolongs the prosperity of the Roman empire and Latium.' But felix
may be masculine and apply to Apollo (= ‘benign’): cf. Verg. Ecl. 5.
65 sis bonus ofelixque tuis.

67. lustrum, i.e. the cycle of 110 years. So Martial (1v. 1. 7),
referring to the celebration of the Ludi Saec- by Domitian, says hic
colat ingenti redeuntia saecula lustro, Et quae Romuleus sacra Terentus
· habet. Most edd. however think that lustrum here is only 5 years and
that Horace alludes to the renewal (in Β. c. 17) of Augustus' s imperium
proconsulare sor five years. But the period is absurdly short and,
besides, Augustus held the tribunicia potestas (which was as important
as the imperium) for life.

68. prorogat. The poet speaks with assurance on behalf of

Apollo. The reading proroget is well supported, ‚but we have had
prayers enough: cf. 1. 74.

69. Aventinum A1g1dumquo. Two very ancient shrines of Diana,
the former founded by the Latin league, the latter by the Aequians.

70. quindetnm virorum, i.e. the X Vviri sacris faciundis who had
charge of the Sibylline books and the surveillance of any new rites.
Augustus himself and Agrippa were both members of the college.

71. puerorum, ‘childrenss the boys and girls of the chorus.

7 3. sentire. The word rs osten used (like sententiam dare) of voting

ἰὸ the senate. Juppiter and all the gods m council vote with Apollo and
iana.

75. doctus, taught by Horace, who was χοροδιδάσκαλος.
