286 HORACE, ODES 111. x, xi.

Ode Χ.

To Lyce, a rich married lady (11. 2, 5, 6).

Scheme. Were you bred to the rigid virtue of the Getae, you would
pity me this cold night. Your pride is displeasing to Venus. You
have no right to give yourself the airs of a Penelope. If nothing else
moves you, spare my life, for I cannot stand here much longer and live.

The ode is a serenade, called in Greek παρακλαυσίθυρον.

Metre. F ourth Asclepiad.

1. 'ranam 81 biberes, cf. Rhodani potor, 11. το. 20 and qui Danu-
bium bibunt 1v. 15. 13. The expression is equivalent to ‘if you were
a Geta or a Scythian.’ The exemplary virtue of these barbarians is
'praised in 111. 24. 9—24.

2. saevo nupta viro, ‘married to a stern husband,’ in Scythia
where all husbands are pretty strict.

asperas, ‘rough-hewn‚' as doorposts are in Scythia.

3. ineolis, ‘the native Northwinds.’ To Greek poets, North winds
came from Scythia.

4. plorares with obicere: ‘you would grieve to expose me.’ The
infin. is like that with gaudeo.

5. nemus. Most editors interpret this of the trees growing in the
inner court of the house. Cf. Epist. 1. 10. 22 inter varias nutritur
silva columnas. But probably the nemus is merely a grove among the
houses of Lyce's neighbourhood.

6. pulchra tecta, opposed to the asperae fores of the Scythians.
People who live in nice houses ought to have nice feelings. And again
ζέἒεζιζα implies comfort, contrasted with the unhappy lover in the

remugiat, ‘roars in answer to the winds.’ ventis, dat.

7. ut glaciet. From audis we must supply sentis ‘do you not
feel?’ For a similar zeugma, see 1. 14. 6 n.

8. puro numine, ‘with unclouded influence.' Frost is keenest on
cloudless nights. luppiter is the air or sky, as in sub love fregido,
1. 1. ἰ 5.

10. nemrota. A proverbial expression meaning ‘lest in attempting
too much you lose the whole.’ The metaphor is from a man who is
hauling up weights with a pulley. 1f the weight is too great, it over-
powers the man as it nears the pulley (when the man grows satigued),
and drops, dragging the rope with it.

11. Penelopen, ⁴ a Penelope.'
difficilem, ‘inexorable,' asin 111. 7. 3²·

12. Tyrrhenus, emphatic. The Tuscans were no prudes and a
Tuscan father would not have a⁶Penelope for daughter.

13. quamvis, with indic. curvat, as in 111. 7. 20.
