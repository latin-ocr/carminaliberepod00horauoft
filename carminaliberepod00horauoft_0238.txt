194 HORACE, ODES Ι. ΧΧνίἰ, xxviii.

9. vnltis. The company is supposed to ask the poet to stay with
them and drink his share.

fr avenz-austeri, probably what we call ‘dry' wine as distinguished
om swee .

ιο. Palem, cf. 1. 20. 9n.

Opuntiae...megy11ae. This name is obviously borrowed fr0m the
Greek original. The lady was a Locrian from Opus.

11. beatus, ‘lucky fellow.'

quo...sag1tta, ‘of what wound, of what shaft from Love's bow
he is languishing.' He is to name the lady as a toast.

13. cessat voluntas. Horace turns to the frater Megyllae. ‘ Does
your willingness fai1?’ i.e. are you unwilling?

14. quae...cumque, cf. 1. 6. 3 n.
venue, ‘channen’ Cf. melior Venus in Ι. 33. 13·

15. non erubescendis, ‘that need not raise a blush'; lit. not to be
blushed for. erubescere, which is properly neuter, sometimes takes an
accus. as A eneid 11. 542 iura fidemque Suppliciis erubuit. So also expal-
lescere has an accus. in Epist. 1. 3. ιο.

adum, ‘scorches' or perhaps humorously ‘singes.’

16. mgenuo...amore. The epithet ‘free-born' belongs to the lady.
For the abl. with peccare cf. 1. 33. 9. For ·que used ‘where the first
clause having a negative form, an adversative conjunction would have
been more usual, cf. 11. η. 9, 11. 20. 4, 111. 30. 6' (Wickham, after
Dillenburger).

18. tutis auribus, ablative of place where. The preposition in is
usually added, as in Sat. 11. 6. 46. There seems to be no authority for
deponere with dat. or with in and accus.

The youth here is supposed to whisper in Horace's ear.

(when you refused to tell).' The other is that laborabas means ‘ you are
struggling‚ though we did not suspect it': the imperfect being similar
to that of ἦν οι· ην ἄρα. in Greek, called by Goodwin (Greek Moods and
Τ. ἓ 39, p- 13) the imperfect of a ‘ fact just recognised.’ Cf. Sophocles
Phil. 978 ὅδ’ ἦν ἄρα ὁ συλλαβών με ‘this, I see now, is the man who
seized me.’ This explanation givesan excellent sense (⁴ you have been
strugglingall this time’) but the Greek usage is so exceedingly rare
(except with ἦν), that it is doubtful if Horace could have borrowed it.
See also the note on erat in 1. 37. 4. '

Charybdi, named as a typical voracious monster, cf. Cic. Philipp. 11.
§7 quae Charybdis tam vorax? For the abl. cf. Aquilonibus laborant
