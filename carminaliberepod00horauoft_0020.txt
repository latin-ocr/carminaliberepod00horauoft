xvi INTRODUCTION.

is given in Sat. 1. 6 and 11. 6. He suffered from dyspepsia and
gout or rheumatism, which caused fits of despondency (Epist.
1. 7 and 8). Ενέη without this information about his healffi, we
might easily infer from his poems that he was not a man of a
hearty and energetic temperament.

Of the other Augustan poets in whom we are most interested,
Horace certainly knew and loved and admired Vergil by far the
best (see esp. C. Ι. 3). He was perhaps familiar with Tibullus (see
C. Ι. 33 and Epist. 1. 4), though Tibullus belonged to the literary
circle of Messalla, not to that of Maecenas. He must have known
and frequently met Propertius, who was another of Maecenas'
prote'gds‚ but for some reason there was no love lost between the
two men. N either mentions the other, but, if Propertius was not
the poet whose impertinence is described in Sat. 1. 9, it is pretty
clear that he was the poet whose vanity is criticised in Epist. 11.
2. 87 sqq. (See Postgate, Select Elegies of Prop. p. xxxii.) ovid,
who was a friend of Propertius, once actually rebukes Horace
(A. A. 11. 271) and omits him from the list of entertaining poets
(A. A. 111. 329— 340), though he pays him a tardy eompliment
after his death (T rist. 1v. 10. 49).

§a Chronology of tlte Odes.

It is generally believed, though it is hardly certain, that the
first three books of the Odes were published together. Sueto-
nius (supra p. xiv n.) says only that Augustus required Horace
to add a fourth book long after the previous three had been
published. But internal evidence is strongly in favour of the
received opinion. Thus (1) the first ode of the series (1. 1) is
addressed to Maecenas, the last but one (111. 29) is also

, addressed to MaecenaS, and the last (111. 30) is a sort of envoi,
· the* poet congratulating himself upon his own achievement.

The first book of the Epistles is constructed on just this plan.
The first letter and the last but one are addressed to Maecenas,
the last is a hutnorous sarewell, committing the book to the
