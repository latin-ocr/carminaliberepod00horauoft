222 HORACE, oDEs 11. iv.

6. Tecmessa. does not appear in Homer, but she has a leading part
in Sophocles' tragedy Ajax.
7. arsit with love. Cf. calet, tepebunt (also with abl.) in 1. 4. 19, 20.

8. rapta. Agamemnon carried away Cassandra, daughter of
Priam, to Argos.

9. barbarae, in the Greek sense of ‘foreign‚’ i.e. Trojan-
10. Thessalo, Achilles, who came from Phthia in Thessaly.

ι ademptus Hector, ‘the loss of Hector! Cf. note on divulsus amor
¹¹¹ 111i3·t1?dd1d.ltis practically equivalent to reliquit. Kiessling quotes
Ovid, Met. lv. 337 loca...lzaec tibi libera trado.

leviora. tom, ‘ more easy of destruction.’ Cf. Introd. p. xxiii.

12. Pergama, the citadel of Troy. The number of Greek words
and names in these first three stanzas suggests that they are a very close
translation from some Greek original.

13—20. These stanzas are, as Dr Postgate suggests, a humorous
descending climax of which the steps are

(1) Her parents may be rich.

th (2) Ῑὲλῒ any rate, they are of royal lineage and have corne down in
e wor .

(3) At least, she does not belong to the criminal classes.
To these the last stanza perhaps adds a fourth step ε

(4) Anyway, she is tolerably pretty, though you need not be jealous
of me on her account.

‘llHere are four reasons for loving her, and if one will not do, another
wi .

13· nescias an...beat1. ‘ You could not tell (if you enquired‚ or if
you were asked) whether her parents are a credit to you by their wealth.’
Possibly, however, nescias is concessive: ‘ granted that you don’t know ’
etc. See Roby L. G. ἐξ 1621, 1622. nescias an has nothing to do
with the idiomatic use of nescio an, ‘ Ῑ am inclined to think,' which use
is entirely confined to the first person singular.

beati (predicative), ‘ wealthy’ : asin 1. 29. 1.
14. flavae, ‘fair-haired' as in 111. 9. 19.

15. regium certe genus. It would seem that slave-girls in Rome
always pretended that they were, of noble birth in their own country.

Probably genus is accus. to maeret: ‘she mourns a royal race and
the fact that her gods are unkind,’ cf. 11. 9. 19-21 cantemus Augusti
tropaea Medumque flumen volvere etc. But possibly we should supply
est with regium. ‘ Her race is at any rate royal and mourns the cruelty
of its gods,’ who have allowed it to come down in the world. Another
alternative, suggested by Kiessling, is to take iniquos, by a kind of
zeugma, with both genus and penates: ‘ she mourns (the uselessness of)
her royal birth and the unkindness of her family gods.’ But such
difficult Latin as this is unsuited to a playful poem.
