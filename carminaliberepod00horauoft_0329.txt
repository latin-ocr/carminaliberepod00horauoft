She. Calais is handsomer than you and better-tempered——but still
1 could live and die with you. .

Metre. Third Asclepiad.
α. potior, a successful rival. Cf. 1v. 1. 17, Epod. 15. ¹3·

4. Pmarnm...beat10r, ‘richer than the king of Persia! The
kings of Persia were beati with tangible wealth (11. 12. 21): the lover
with happiness.

5. aha, abl. with arsisti, ‘fell in love with another girl.’ Cf. arsit
virgine rapta, 11. 4. 8.

6. Chloen, cf. 1. ²3·

7. multi Lyrna nominis, ‘of wide renown.' Cf. Aeneid 11. 89 et

nos aliquod nomenque decusque Gessimus. For the descriptive gen. cf.
lv. 1. 15 centumpuer artium. Roby L. G. S 1308.

8. clarior, ‘more famous? She was not really famous any more
than Horace was rich. What she means is that it was fame enough for
her to be known as his sweetheart.

ma, cf. 1. 2. 17, 111. 3. 2. That form of the legend which identified
Ra Silvia with Ilia seems to be due to Ennius. She is called Romana
here because Lydia and her lover are supposed to be Greeks.

ro. docta modos, cs. 111. 8. 5.

citha-1²20 mens, cf. pugnae sciens in 1. 15. 24.

12. numae, ‘ if the fates spate my darling to survive me.’ anima

¹8: cs. also sub iuga aenea mittere in 1. 33. 11. The abl. however

mutar, ‘is shaken off ἰ the yoke of Chloe is meant.

ιο. retectae...1.yma.o‚ enitive‚ not dative. The gentlemen called ,
on the ladies, as is clear rom 1. 25. 1-8, 111. 7. 2 , and 10. 3. If
Lydia's door is open, that implies that she has got rid90f Calais and is

herself ‘open' to another lover. The stanza means ‘What if we love
one another again and are both free from entanglements? '

tumn. levior, ⁸ more unsteady' than a cork in the water. Cf. 1. 6. 20
praeter solitum leves.
