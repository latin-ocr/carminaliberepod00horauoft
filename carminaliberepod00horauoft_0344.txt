commodis, ‘to suit the taste.'

13. imparis, ‘uneven ’ in number, nine to wit.
14. attonitus, ‘inspired,' ἐνθουσιὰζων.

15. tris supra, either ‘more than three ’ or ‘ three more,' meaning
the three parts which (with the original nine orathi of wine) would make
the drink merum, pure wine. The former interpretation is the more

probable, as there seem to have been two mixtures and, besides, the
Graces were three in number.

16. rixarum metuens, cf. 111. 24. 22 metuens alterius viri: 1. 15.
24 sciens pugnae.

invidus, ‘ the curmudgeon‚’ who begrudges youth its pleasures.

24. non habilis, ‘intractable.’ vicina (6 the lady next door ') seems
to be Lycus’ wife, a young woman ill-matched with an old man. It is

possible, however, that the vicina is Rhode, who loves Telephus and
turns a deaf ear to Lycus.

25. te, strongly contrasted with me of 1. 28. Horace is unfortunate

in love, Telephus is fortunate. Perhaps Horace means to explain why
he tries to drown love in wine.

used elsewhere by Horace: Glycera in 1. 19, 1. 30, 1. 33. Telephus
