INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

stay-at·horne life os Horace gives extra point to his welcome of
the wanderer Pompeius: and in 111. 23 and 24 the praise of
simple piety leads up to a denunciation of wealth.

. §z The Text.

Horace's works, as he himself prophesied (Epist. Ι. 20. 17,
18), soon became one of the regular Roman schoolbooks. They
were so in the time of Quintilian and Juvenal (say A.D. 100), and
remained so in the time of Ausonius (say A.D. 380). Vergil, too,
shared the same fate (see Mayor's note on Juvenal vn. 227).
But while of Vergil we have several MSS. complete or fragmen-
tary‚ which date from a very high antiquity (earlier than A.D.
500), we have only one of Horace which is as old as the 9th
century. Most of the extant MSS. of Horace were written in
the roth century or later.

Moreover, no extant MS. of Horace seems to have been
written in Italy. The oldest, called B (Beruensis, of the 9th
century), is a fragmentary copy written in Ireland. The others
appear to have been all written in France or Germany after that
revival of schools and of literary studies which Charlemagne
introduced with the assistance of Alcuin of York (about A.D.
820). There is evidence that Horace was well known to some
students at this time, though many years must have elapsed
before the reading of profane poets was permitted in the
cathedral schools of the German Empire. At Paderborn, for
instance, it was not till after A.D. 1000 that it could be said
‘viguit Horatius, magnus et Virgilius, Crispus ac Salustius et
Urbanus Statius! (See Maitland’s Dark Ages, Nos. XI. and
vlu. and Class. Review 1894, p. 305.)

of the extant MSS„ other than B, the chief are Αφψλπ, all
now at Paris: δ and d, both in the British Museum: R, now in
the Vatican (though it was written in Alsace): l at Leyden: a
at Milan: ν at Dessau. All these, with some others, are
assigned to the 10tb century, and there are many more of later

dato.
