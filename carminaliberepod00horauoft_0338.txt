Ode ΧνΙ.

To Maecenas.

Scheme. Gold found a way to Danae in her tower and no pro·
tection is proof against it. But greed for gold brings anxieties in its
train, therefore I avoid it. A modest station and contentment there·
with make me ripher than all the wealth of Africa or Phrygia. (Cf. 11.
16,11. 18,111. 1.

Some editors suggest that the ode was written at the time when
