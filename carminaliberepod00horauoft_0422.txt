378 HORACE, EPODE 1x.

nausea of l. 35 was veritable sea-sickness. There is still a dispute,
however, as to whether the poem was written before or after the battle.
The confidence with which Hor. speaks of the flight of Antony
(ll. 27-32) suggests that he was writing after the battle. Prof.
Housman on the other hand, who believes that the poem was written
before the battle, urges the following arguments: (1) the defection of
’ 2000 Gauls from Antony must have seemed a trifling event after the
battle, though it was a good omen before: (2) nothing is said of the
actual conflict, e.g. the burning· of Antony’s ships ε ’(3) the reference to
‘anxiety and sear for Caesar’s sortunes' (1. 37) is grotesque aster such a
victory. The last argument is strongly against Prof. Nettleship's sug·
gestion that ll. 1—20 were written before the battle, the rest after the
victory. Prof. Housman's view (soum. 0f Philology‚ 1882, p. 193) is
adopted in the following notes z see esp. that on 1. 17.

1. Caecubum, one of the choicest wines of Italy (cf. Carm. Ι. 20. 9),
produced on the coast of Latium, between Terracina and Formiae.

repostum-dapes, ‘stored up for festal banquets! repostum is used
also by Vergil (Aen. 1. 1. 26): ef.postos 2. 65, puertiae Carm. 1. 36. 8.
surpuerat lv. 13. 20. For ad, used of time like our ‘against,’ cf. Cic.
Off 11. 23. 82 rem integram ad reditum suum iussit esse.

3. sub alta...domo. Maecenas had a very lofty and conspicuous
house on the Esquiline: cf. Car-m. 111. 29. 10, where it is called moles
pggpingqizta nubibus. Nero watched the burning of Rome from the

eie Iovi gratum. The point seems to be that this crowning victory
was to be celebrated at home and in every Roman home.

4. beate Maecenas, cf. Carm. 1. 4. 14 o beate Sesti. beatus means
‘ fortune's favourite,’ especially in regard to wealth.

5. trous (abl.) for ‘the music of the tibiae.’ The double pipes are
meant, asin C. 1. 1. 32.

6. barbarum, Phrygian‚ as in C. 111. 19. 18. As the lyre, playing
Δωριστί, would be out of tune with the pipes playing Φρυγιστὶ, we must
suppose that they played alternately and mixtum of 1. 5 means, in effect,
‘interchanged with.'

7. nuper, in 13.c. 36, when Agrippa defeated Sextus Pompeius at
Naulochus. actus freto seems to mean ‘driven off the sea‚’ for Pompeius
fied to Mytilene and thence into Asia.

Neptunius. S. Pompeius called himself the son of Neptune.

10. servis, constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ (Introd. p. xxv) with detraxerat
Ξὲἳθιειηὶἔῗιὲ. {gre fleet of Pompeius was largely manned by fugitive

11. posteri negabitis, cf. credite posteri, C. 11. 19. 11. Romanus
is separated sor emphasis from miles l. 13.

12. emanmpatus, ‘handed over‚' as property. emancipare is liter-
ally ‘to deliver out of one's possession (mancipium) and sometimes
means ‘to sell’: cs. Cic. Phil. 11. 21. 51 iste venditum atque emanci-
patum tribunatum consiliis vestris opposuit. Dion (L. 5) relates that
