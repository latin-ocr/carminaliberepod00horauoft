group (pr person) : whereas the subj. is used where the reference is to a

amomo probably means ‘with the chariot' (as in Ov. T rist. lv, 8.
36 curriculo gravis est sacta ruina meo), not ⁴ on the racc-course? With
the latter meaning we should expect Olympico instead of Olympicum.

turbine pulvis, Sat. 1. 4. 31. For the perf. cf. gaudet pepulisse J‘bssor,

Olympicum. The reference is to the great Olympian games held at
Pisa in Elis, in honour of Olympian Zeus. The epithet is hardly
natural in a Roman writer, but Horace, as an avowed imitator of
Greek poets, very often adopts from them familiar epithets: e.g.
Cypria, Myrtoum, Jcan‘z's below 11. 13-15.

4. meta, ‘the turning-post,' with which it was fatal to collide. In
Sophocles’sslectra, 720-748, there is a description of a chariot·race in
which Orestes took part. It is told how, ln the earlier munds, he
artfully took the turn so close as to shave the post, but in the last round
he struck it and was upset.

5. evitata.. The preposition has some suggestion of an ejaculation
from the excited spectators, cf. emirabitur in 1. 5. 6.

palma nobilis, ‘the glorious palm.' The prize at Olympian games
was a crown of wild olives, but a palm-branch also was given to the
victor at these and all the other great games.

6. terrarum dominos, in apposition with deos.- as in ovid, Ejp. ex
Ponto 1. 9. 36 terrarum dominos quam colis ipse deos. Some scholars
prefer to take dominos as part of the aecus. after evehit (⁴raises them to
heaven, very lords of the world‚’1 Wickham). In Horace’s way of
reading the line (which we do not knOW, see Introd. p. xxvi) the meaning .
must have been plain, and the quotation from Ovid seems the best clue ·
to it. The sentiment is repeated 1v. α. 17 quos Elea domum reducit
palma caelestes. On the punctuation, see Critical Note.

7. huno is governed by iuvat in l. 4. the intervening sentence
palmaque...de0s being a picturesque parenthesis, such as we often find in
similes, e.g. 1V. 4. 1-16.

mobilium turba. Q. Cf. Tac. Hist. v. 8 (reges) mobilitate vulgi
expulsi. In Horace’s time the forms of popular election were still
maintained and statutes were passed to prevent bribery and rioting at
the comitia, but the magistrates were mere nominees of Augustus. See
Pelham's Roman Hz'story, pp. 388-391.

8. tergeminis honoribus (insu. abl.) seems to referto the regular ¹

cursus honorum of quaestor, praetor and consul.
