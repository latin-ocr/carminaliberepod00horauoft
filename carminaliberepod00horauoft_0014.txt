x INTRODUCTION.

By profession, he was a tax-collector or debt-collectorl, perhaps
also a dealer in salt—fish (salsamentarius)‚ if Suetonius may be
trusted. From small beginnings²‚ he seems to have acquired
some fortune, sufficient, at any rate, to warrant him in remov-
ing from Venusia to Rome, and devoting himself to his son's
educati0n³. To his father's fond and judicious care of him, ¹
during his school days, Horace more than once bears eloquent
testimony4.

At* Rome, Horace was put to an expensive school⁶, kept by
a crusty old grammarian, L. Orbilius Pupillus, nicknamed ‘the
flogger.’ Here he studied, among other things, the early Latin
poets⁶ (such as Livius Andronicus) and the Iliad of Homer⁷.

From school Horace proceeded (about the age of 19, no
doubt) to the university of Athens, where he attended the
lecturus of the Academy⁸. The course would include geometry,
logie, moral philosophy and probably also rhetoric or literary
criticism. In after years, Horace no longer adhered to the

slave and must have been a foreigner, and (2) that Horace at an early
age was sufficiently fluent in Greek to write Greek verses (Sat. 1. ιο.
31—35). It is not known how the father acquired the name of
Horatius. According to usage, Flaccus (⁸ flap-eared') would have been
his slave-name and Horatius the name of his former master. (See Dict.
of Antiq. 3rd ed. s. v. Nomen.) The colony of Venusia was enrolled
in the tribus IIoratia, and the father may have been a slave in the
service of the town.
