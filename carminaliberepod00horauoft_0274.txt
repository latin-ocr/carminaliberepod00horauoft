230 HORACE, ODES Π. viii, ix. .

tibi crescit, ‘is growing up for your-profit, is growing, I say, to be a
fresh band of your slaves.'

1 8. servitus mensi, as iuventus often = iuvenes. The words servitus
nova are predicative with the second crescit.

1 9. impiae = periurae.

22. senes parci are anxious sor their sons, because Barine leads

24. tua aura, either t‘he breeze that favours you’ (cf. incerta
Cupidinis aura in Ovid Am. 11. 9. 3) οι· ‘the breeze of your favour’

sense, however, adds nothing ‘to vexant.

Cf. Propertius V. 11. r desine, Paulle, meum lacrimis urgere sepulcrum.
