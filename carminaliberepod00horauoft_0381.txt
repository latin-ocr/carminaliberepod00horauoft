NOTES. 337

Ode vl.

This ode is obviously a prelude to the Carmen Saeculum, which was

- written sor the Ludi Saeculares of B.c. 17. The poet claims here, for

ἷξε ὲῗςει· composition, the assistance of Apollo, and the attention of
e orus,

Scheme. Apollo, who punishest a boastful tongue,—it was thy
doing that Achilles fell and Aeneas was preserved from slaughter to
found Rome—maintain now the honour of Italian poesy. Ye girls and
boys, mark my beat when you sing the praises of Apollo and Diana.
Heraeftier, yffi will be proud to remember that you sang my ode at the

Mare. Sapphic.

ι. magnae mdloom ung-uae, ‘punisher of a boastful tongue.’
This aspect of Apollo seems to be emphasized in order to emphasize,
· by implioetion‚ the modesty of Horace. The poet's first thought, when
he was asked to compose a Carmen Saeculare‚ was to ask for the aid of

Apollo. magna lingua is a translation of μεγάλη γλῶσσα.

prole· mom Niobe, who had six sons and six daughters, boasted
of her superiority to Latona, who had only two children. For this
insolence. Latona's children, Apollo and Diana, slew Niobe's children.

The story is told in Iliad xxlv. 602.
α. 'ntyon was a giant who offered outrage to Latona and was also
slain by Apollo and Diana: cf. especially 111. 4. 77 and Odyssey XI. 576.
3. mult, ‘found to his cost’: cf. 1v. 4. 25.

propo with victor, ‘almost victorious,' cf. Cic. Fam. 1. 4. 1 paene
amicus. Achilles slew Hector but was himself slain‚ before the capture

of Troy, by A llo (so Soph. Philoct. 334) or by Paris with the aid of
Apollo (aoeo ing to Hector’s prophecy in Iliad xxu. 358).

4. mnu. Achilles’ home was at Phthia in Thessaly.

ἕπῃ These five stanzas are parenthetic. The invocation is re·

mu inmas, ‘ no match sor thee’ : cf. Aeneid 1. 475 infelix puer atque

ἐς mann, sor Dardanias, cs. 1v. 5. 1 Romulae gentis.

8. eumue with quateret. The spear of Achilles is described by
'Homer (Ῑζ. xlx. 388) as βριθὺ μέγα στιβαρόν· τὸ μὲν οὐ δύνατ’ ἄλλος
Δχαιων naxia» κ.τ.λ. quateret= Homer s ἐλέλιξεν, ‘made them quake.'

pugnax, ‘eager for battle‚' 111. 3. 27. (Some edd. connect cuspide
pugnax: cs. Livy xxu. 37 pugnaces missili telo gentes.)

n. late, ‘sprawling huge.' So in Odyssey xxw. 39 the ghost of
Agamemnon says to the ghost of Achilles σὺ δ’ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης
κεῖσο μέγα, μεγαλωστί.

13. me. The repeated pronoun, as Wickham says, marks the
