INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

name of Acron were evidently put together by a writer who lived
some time after the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity.
These scholia are not of much assistance in the attempt to
restore the words of Horace himself. Often they do not com-
ment on the words in dispute and, when they do, Porphyrion
often supports one reading, Acron the other. Sometimes, too,
one reading is quoted as a heading to a note while the note
itself explains the other. No editor has at present found the
clue to au this tangle. Messrs Keller and Holder, who have
examined far more MSS. than anybody else, have divided them
into three classes, but the grounds on which they base this
division are most unsatisfactory.

The chief editions of the text of Horace during the last 350
years are those of M. A. Muretus (Venice, 1551), D. Lambinus
(Lyons, 1561), J. Cruquius (Antwerp, 1578), D. Heinsius (Leyden,
1605), T. Faber (Saumur, 1671), R. Bentley (Cambridge, 1711),
C. Fea (Rome, 1811), F. Pottier (Paris, 1823), A. Meineke
(Berlin, 1834), P. H. Peerlkamp (Haarlem, 1834), J. C. Orelli
(Zurich, 1837), W. Dillenburger (Bonn, 1844), F. Ritter (Leipzig,
1856), K. Lehrs (Leipzig, 1859), H. A. J. Munro (Cambridge,
1869), Ο. Keller and A. Holder (ed. major, Leipzig, 1864—1870
and ed. minor, Leipzig, 1879). Among these, the edition of
J. Cruquius is especially noteworthy because it is founded
mainly on some MSS. (Blandinii) which formerly existed at
Ghent (Blandenberg Abbey), but which were burnt in 1566
soon after Cruquius collated them. One of them, which editors
call V (vetustissimus), was a very good MS„ but not specially
good in the odes. Fea used the MSS. now in Italy: Orelli
those in Switzerland: Pottier those in Paris. Other editors have
chosen MSS. in different librarieS. Keller and Holder have
inspected about 50 MSS. and have carefully collated about 25 in
various countrieS.

The chief commentaries on Horace, at least in regard to the
collection of illustrative matter, are those of Orelli and Dillen-
burget.
