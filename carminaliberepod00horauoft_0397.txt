habitamus, i.e.inhabited‚ ἡ οἰκουμένη.

6. melpum. For princeps as a title of Augustus, cf. 1.' 2. 50 n.

7. quem—didicere—quid posses. An imitation of the Greek
usage, whereby the subject of the subordinate clause is inserted as

8. Vindelici. This seems to be used as a generic name for the

9. qum possea, cf. lv. 4. 25-28 sensere quid posset.

ιο. Genuum, Breuni, neighbouring tribes, who occupied the valleys

ete.’ ἅς compares θαυμαστὸς ὅσοις. ‘It was a sight to see with what
fleme overthrow he wore down the courage of hearts resolute to die

in freedom!

το. quana. The construction is qualis Auster, etc. (tali modo)
impiger etc. Objection has been justly taken to prope as prosaic.
