too.' It is certainly possible that Horace would have ended a line
with et, but the sfielling forset is attested by Servius on Aeneicl 11. ¹39

and XI. 50. Ore i actually contends that ‘sors' here means ‘fortune '
and is part of the nom. to maneant.

32. debita iura. debeo properly means ‘to withhold' (de-habeo). As
Cicero says (Plane. 29. 68), qui debet, aes retinet alienum. Here debita
iura means ‘rights unpaid ’ to you, i.e. neglect of your right to burial.
All editors, however, take it as meaning ‘rights owed by you ' and
regard this as a synonym for ‘ penalties.’

vices superbae, ‘a requital of insolence‚’ i.e. as Dr Postgate suggests,

an insolent requital for your insolence‚ cf. Prop. 1. 13. 10 multarum
miseras cngret una vices.

33. non unquar, se. a te, ‘you cannot leave me without incurring
vengeance for my prayers (unheard).’ precibus is the prayer for burial,
not the curse, precibus inultis abl. abs. ·

35. licebit cunae, ‘ you may go your way.'

36. ter. Three handfuls will suffice. Three was the ceremonia]
number, cf. Aeneia VI. 229 and 506 magna Manes ter voce vocavi.

Ode ΧΧΙΧ.

To Iccius, a student of philosophy, who was intending to join the
expedition to Arabia under Aelius Gallus. The expedition, which
started in 13.c. 24, was a sajlure. We learn from Epist. 1. 12. 1, written
five years later, that Iccius was then managei· of some estates in Sicily
(Agrippa's, if the reading is right). Nothing more is known of him.

Schema. What, Iccius, are you casting a greedy eye on the treasures
of Araby and preparing to conquer the Orient? What dusky virgin,
what princely boy is to become your slave? Who can deny that rivers
may flow upward when you abandon philosophy for war?

Metre. Alcaic.
⁸ 1. benus, ‘rich.’ The epithet is properly applied to persons, as
m 11. 4. 13.

Arabum. Owing to the great eost of spices, pearls, ivory and other
oriental products which reached Europe by way of the Red Sea,
exaggerated ideas prevailed in Rome about the wealth of Arabia, cf. 11.
12. 24 and 111. 24. 1 intactis opulentior thesaum's Arabum.

2. gazis, a Persian word.
3. Sabaeae, ‘ Sheba ' in the S. of Arabia.

4. Medo. There is a kind of climax here, as if the expedition were
likely to go further and further into Asia, and to win the long-desired
victory over the Parthians. Horace of course is ‘ chaffing' his friend.
