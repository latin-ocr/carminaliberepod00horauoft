NOTES. 201

mh is usually interpreted ‘ procured in exchange.’ Syra merce
is thus abl. instr- (as with mutare 1. 16. 26 ra). This use of reparare is
cmainly very rare, and Bentley denied it altogether. He thought that
repoeata Syra merce meant ‘ mixed with spikenard‚’ according to the
practice of woelthy Romans.

The merchant, who goes three or four times a year to the aequor
Atlanmnz (l. 14), would not bring Syrian merchandise thence. If

rata means ‘ proeured‚’ we must suppose that the merchant, being
rich, brought choice unguents to the dinner-party as his contribution.
It was usual, in Rome, to bring such presents to the host (IV. 12.
14, 16).

13. mn σαι-118 ipsis, ‘ the favourite’ (not of fortune only‘, but) of the

16. leven, ‘easily digestible.’ Cf. Epod. 2. 58 gravi malvae
salubres corpori.

17. ατί paraus, ‘ to enjoy what Ι have gained.’

tundo, ‘ sound in body’ as well as 'integra cum mente. But see next

1. poam. See critical note. Editors conjecture that Horace
had been asked by Augustus or Maecenas to compose some more serious
and lofty odes, such as 111. 1—6. But the conjecture is quite un·
wanted by the poem. In 11. 8-12 Horace lays stress on the fact
that Alcaeus wrote os love and in 11. 13-16 he lays stress on the gentle
chama of the lyre3 The mserence is that he was asked now to write a
love-poem m Alcmcs. The use os vacui supporta this.
