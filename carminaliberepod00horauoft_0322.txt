The stanza, according to Mommsen (Mon. A n'cyr. p. 125), refers not
to Carrhae which was among the delicta maiorum, but to two later
defeats of the Romans by the Parthians. The first was 13.c. 40 when
the army of Pacorus defeated Decidius Saxa, Antony's legate in Syria:
the second was B. C. 36, when Monaeses defeated two legions under
Oppius Statianus‚ forming part of a force commanded by Antony himself.
