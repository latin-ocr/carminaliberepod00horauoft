208 HORACE, ODES Ι. xxxv, xxxvi.

24. potentis domos. The great familiae of Rome had their own
Fortuna, as Fortuna Torquatiana, Tulliana, Caesariana.

inimica. This word, as was pointed out above, disturbs the con·
ception‚ for the Fortune of a house is practically the history of the
house, and cannot be hostile to it. She suffers what the house suffers.
Cf. Epist. 11. 1. 191 trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis.

26. cadis...siecatts, abl. abs. Cf. the Greek proverb ζεῖ χύτρα, ζῇ

φιλία, and the English one ‘when poverty comes in at the door, love
flies out at the window.'

28. ferre iugum pariter dolosi, ‘ dishonest in bearing the yoke
equally,’ i.e. not true yoke-fellows‚ a metaphor from a pair of cattle
that do not work equally hard together.

29—40. The Fortuna of these stanzas seems to be the Fortuna
Populi Romani, but Horace may be simply returning to his first
conception of F ortune as the goddess who rules the world.

29. Gaesarem. It was in B.c. 26 that Augustus, then in Gaul,
contemplated a campaign in Britain.

M ultimos orbis Britannos. Cf. Aeneid VIII. 727 extremi hominum
orma.

30. reeens examen. The expedition to Arabia, in which Iccius
(1. 29) was to take part, seems to have been planned in B-C. 26, though

it did not start till B.c. 24. The word examen (properly ‘swarm' of
bees) perhaps indicates the enthusiasm of the young volunteers.

· 32. Oceano rubro. The Indian Ocean.
34. fratrumque, sc. occisorum, referring to the civil wars.
35. nefasti for nefandi, ‘ of wickedness.’ For the gen. cf. 1. 3. 37.

S 37. metus deorum is. piety. On the other hand timor deorum
< αξξ. 31:025) IThZPZII-jittltibznproperly belongs to the swords‚ but is
transferred by hypallage to the anvil. Cf. 1. 3. 40.

39. diffingas, ‘forge anew.' Properly dffngere is ‘to change the
form of‚' as in 111. 29. 47. ⁴

rotumum, ‘ blunted' in civil wars.

40. Massagetas. A tribe living near the Caspian Sea, to the
N. E. of the Parthians. The neighbourhood of the Caucasus and the

Caspian was of great interest to the Romans from B-C. 30 to 20, and is
often mentioned in Horace. See especially 11. 9.

Ode xxxvl.

Scheme. Let us give thanks to the gods who have brought back
our Numida sase, to the delight of his old companions especially of
Lamia. The day deserves a white mark. We will celebrate it with

wine and dancing, and Damalis shall have a drinking-match with ⁶

Bassus. We all love Damalis, but she will not leave the embrace of
Nutfgdss. not known who Numida was or whence he was returning.
