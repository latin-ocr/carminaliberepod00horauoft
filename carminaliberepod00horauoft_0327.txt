NOTES. 283 Α

11. fumum bibere matutae. The apotheca was placed at the top
of the house, because the smoke from the fires was thought to mellow
the wine. Cf. Ovid Fasti v. 518 promit fumoso condita vina cado.

12. consulo Tullo. One L. Volcatius Tullus was consul B.C. 66,
another in B.C. 33. The latter date is probably meant. The wine was
probably Sabine (1. 20. 1), which would not keep (1. 9. 7), and newish
wine was used at sacrifices (1. 19. 15).

13· γ cyathos eentum. The cyathus was certainly a small measure,
one-twelsth of a sextarius (pint), but it seems also to have meant a
ladle, containing phout that quantity, used for dipping in the cratera or
large mixing-bow .

eentum is commonly supposed to be used for an indefinitely large
number, ‘no end of ladles full,’ but it may be taken strictly, for the
Romans used to pray for as many years of life as they could drink
cyathi. Cf. Ovid Fasti 111. 531 annosque precantur Quot sumant
cyathos ad numerumque bibunt. In the latter case, Horace asks
Maecenas to wish him a hundred years of life and happiness.

amm mptum ‘to the health of your friend happily preserved.’
For the gen. cs. 111. ¹9· 9 da lunae novae, da Murenae. It is imitated
gogcmhutshe Greek idiom: e.g. ἔγχει καὶ πάλιν εἰπὲ ‘Araxates’ in Calli-

14. vig-111⁸ lucernas, cf. 111. 21. 23 vivae lucernae etc.

15. perrer=‘ endure.’ Epist. 1. 15. 17 quidvis perferre patique.
Maecenas was in ill-hoelth and not fond of sitting up late.

ln lucem, ‘till morning,' dum rediens fugat astra Phoebus.

procul omma etc. This seems to be an injunction to the other
guests and intended to reassure Maecenas.

¹⁷· mitte, ‘dismiss' as in 1. 38. 3.

olvffln curas seems to mean ‘political cares.’ Cf. Epist. 1. 1. 16
mmor civilibus undis. In Quintilian civilis vir is frequently used for
‘a statesmanss Wickham and Orelli think civilis means ‘domestic,'

aa to the foreign affairs presently mentioned. But if so, why
are oreign affairs mentioned at all?

nuper urbo. Such cares are meant as those of the com-supply
(annona) and the games (ludi publici), on which the good-humour of
the Roman mob depended.

18. Daci musonis. Suetonius (Oct. 63) calls Cotiso king of the
Getae: Florus calls him king of the Daci. The Getae, Sacae and
Daci were neighbouring and kindred tribes, and are believed by some
modern writers to have been fragments of the Gothic, saxon and

Danish nations, who had in some way penetrated into the South or
been lest behind there.

19. mus, the Parthian, as in 1. 2. 51. The reference is to the
quarrels between Phraates and Tiridates, mentioned in 1. 26. 5 and Π.
