15. resorbens, transitive, ‘sucking you back.’ For a similar
metaphor cf. Epist. 11. 2. 47 civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma.

16. fretis, dat. like caelo tuleris ιιι 111. 23. 1.

19. lauru, the proper tree for a poet’s garden-

nec, not neu(cf.1. 11. 2, 11. 11. 4), because this is not a separate
