INTRODUCTION. ΧΧίΧ

This rhythm is trochaic, with an anacrusis (or ‘striking-up’
syllable) at the beginning of lines 1, 2, 3.

2. The Sapphic stanza is used in 25 odes, viz.:

1. 2. 10. 12. 20. 22. 25. 30. 32. 38.
11. 2. 4. 6. 8. ιο. 16.

111. 8. 11. 14. 18. 20. 22. 27.

lv. 2. 6. 11 and Carmen Saeculare.

The stanza seems to have been invented by Alcaeus, though
it is named after Sappho. The metrical scheme is:

1, 2, 3. - υ - - - ‚ υ υ - ψ - v (eleven syllables).
4· — υ υ - 0- (five syllables).

The longer line is called tlte lesser S apphic: the shorter the
Adom‘us.

In the longer line Horace always has the fourth syllable
long, whereas Sappho (and Catullus) often had it short.

Horace has also introduced a caesura, which was not used
by Sappho. This caesura, in the first three Books, generally
occurs after the sth syllable, and only occasionally aster the 6th
(eg. 1. 10. 1, 6, 18), but in the fourth Book and Carm. Sacc. it is
very frequently placed after the 6th syllable (in fact, 39 times in
only four compositions).

Synapheia is obviously respected between the znd and 3rd
lines in 11. 2. 18: 16. 34: 1v. 2. 223 where final syllables are
elided: and between the 3rd and 4th lines in 1. 2. 19: 25. 11:
ιι. 16. 7: lv. 2. 23: Carm. Saec. 47, where either a word is
divided (as in the first three passages) or a syllable elided (as in

the last two .
Yet hiatiis between the lines frequently occurs, as in 1. 2. 41

and 47: 12. 6 and 7 etc.
Τὴε original rhythm, according to Dr Schmidt, was trochaic

and may be represented thus :
