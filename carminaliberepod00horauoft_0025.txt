INTRODUCTION. xxi

his poems are not, to use Wordsworth's phrase, ‘the sponta-
neous overflow of powerful feeling! He himself describes them
as laborious (operosa carmina C. 1v. 2. 31). But they are sincere,
that is to say, they are the genuine expression of his thoughts and
sentiments3 and if they do not reveal to us a man of profound
insight or ardent passions or losty imagination, they show at
least sympathy, affection, humour, a generous admiration of
great men and noble deeds, and a sturdy pride in his vocation.
And a man with these qualities, if his vocation happens to be
literature, has always been sure of a lasting success. The tact
which results from his sympathy and humour appears in his
style as well as in his matter, and his writings have the charm
which is recognized as ‘companionable.' In our own country,
Addison and Lamb, in France, Montaigne and Mme. de
sevigne, are conspicuous examples of the Horatian tempera-
ment and of its enduring popularity. And Horace had the
advantage of writing in verse and of using a language which
gave the utmost assistance to his special literary talent. ‘The
best words in the best places' is a definition of poetry that
Coleridge was fond of repeating. It might serve sor a descrip-
tion os Horace's writing. He was gifted by nature with a fine
ear and an infinite capacity for taking pains, and he had had
a scholarly education. He borrowed, from Greek, metres of
peculiar swing, and he had, in his native Latin, a store of
sonorous and pregnant words, a terse and lucid grammar, and
the liberty to arrange his words to the best advantage. With
these resources, he has produced an incomparable series of
brilliant phrases (‘jewels five words long' Tennyson calls them)
which are at once easy to remember and impossible to translate ¹.

¹ It is idle to quote instances where almost every line is an instance,
but one might choose simplex munditiis or insaniens sapientia or
splendide mendax as examples of Horace’s untranslateable brevity:
dulce et decorum est pro patria mori or nihil est ab omni parte beatum as
examples of finished commonplace: non indecoro pulvere sordidos or
intaminatis fulget honoribus or impavidum seriem ruinae as specimens
οἱ sonority, and qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratem as an instance
of the ansul arrangement os contrasted words.
