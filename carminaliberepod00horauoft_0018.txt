xiv INTRODUCTION.

victory at Actium and to hail Caesar as the saviour of society1.
But there is no sign, even as late as ΒΕ. 20, when the first book
of Epistles was published, that Horace was intimate with the
emperor. Augustus was perhaps too busy, and too often
absent from Rome2‚ to cultivate the poet's acquaintance. But
the intimacy, whenever it beganss, was of great importance to
Horace. He yielded to Augustus what he had refused to
Maecenas⁴‚ and resumed the writing of lyric poetry, which he
had meant to abandon. Thus in B.C. 17 he wrote the Carmen
Saeculare by command, and about B.C. 14 the odes Carm. lv. 4
and 14, which formed the nucleus of the fourth book. Sueto-
nius, who tells us this, tells us also that Epist. 11. 1 was written
at the express request of Augustus, who wished his name to be
connected with a composition of this class ⁶.

The F ourth Book of the Odes was published about B.c. 14,
the Second Book of the Epistles about B.c. 12⁶. Itis observ-
able that in these works the name of Maecenas is no longer
prominent. The first Satire of the first book, the first Epode‚
the first Ode, the first Epistle had all been addressed to him in

² Epod. 9. Carm. 1. 2 and 37.

² He was absent from Rome B-C. 31 to 29 and 27 to 24: was very
ill in 23, and was absent again B.c. 22—19 (October).

⁸ Epist. 1. 9 shows that Horace had some acquaintance with Tiberius

before B-C. 20, and perhaps Epist. 1. 13 shows as much acquaintance
with Augustus.

⁶ sffetonius says, ‘⁴ scripta quidem eius (Augustus) usque adeo probavit
mansuraque perpetuo opinatus est, 'ut non modo saeculare carmen

ι componendum iniunxerit, sed et vindelicam victoriam T iberii Drusique

privignorum suorum, eumque coegerit propter hoc tribus carminum
libris ex longo intervallo quartum addere: post semones vero quosdam
lectos nullam sui mentionem habitam ita sit questus ‘irasci me tibi
scito, quod non in plerisque eiusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris.
An vereris ne apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris

nobis esse ?’ Expressitque eclogam ad se cuius initium est: ‘ Cum tot?
mstimas‚’ etc.''

⁸ The date of the Ars Poetica is very uncertain.
