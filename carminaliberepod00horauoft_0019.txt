INTRODUCTION. XV

grateful homage for his kindness, but there is no allusion to
him in the later publications save an affectionate record os his
birthday in Carm. 1v. 11. vIt is known, from Tacitus (Ann.
111. 30), that after B.c. 20 there was a coolness between
Maecenas and Augustusl. It is clear, too, from SuetoniuS,
that Augustus made efforts to detach Horace from Maecenas,
first by offering him a secretaryship‚ which was declined, and
afterwards by encouraging him to familiarity and giving him
handsome presents2. One may imagine, therefore, that Horace
was in an awkward and unhappy position. He was not easy
with Augustus but dared not offend him, and perhaps his
compliance with the emperor's commands roused some jealousy
in Maecenas. But the estrangement, if there was one, between
the poet and his patron did not endure. On his deathbed,
Maecenas wrote to Augustus ‘Horati Flacci, ut mei, memor
esto! He died early in B.C. 8, and Horace followed him to the
grave in the same year, on November 27th.

Horace describes himself, in B.c. 20, as ‘ short, prematurely
grey, fond of the sunshine, quick-tempered but easily appeased³.’
Some account of his daily habits in Rome and in the country

¹ Augustus had an intrigue with Maecenas’ wife, Terentia, but
Tacitus does not mention this.

² The following extracts from Suetonius’ life of Horace will suffice:
‘Augustus epistularum quoque officium obtulit, ut hoc ad Maecenatem
scripto significat: ‘ante ipse sufficiebam scribendis epistulis amicorum,
nunc occupatissimus et infirmus Horatium nostrum a te cupio abducere.
Veniet ergo ab ista parasitica mensa ad hanc regiam, et nos in epistulis
scribendis adiuvabit) Ac ne recusanti quidem aut succensuit quicquam
aut amicitiam suam ingerere desiit. Exstant epistulae e quibus argumenti

gratia pauca subieci: ‘sume tibi aliquid iuris apud me, tanquam si . ²

convictor mihi fueris; recte enim et non temere feceris quoniam id usus
mihi tecum esse volui, si per valetudinem tuam fieri possit.'...Praeterea
saepe...homuncionem lepidissimum adpellat unaque et altera liberalitate
locupletavit! Horace had, in his later yearS, a house at Tibur, which
was still shown in Suetonius’ time. This is supposed to have been
presented to him by Augustus.

⁸ Epist. 1. το. 24, 25 (corporis exzssgui, praecanum, solibus aptum,1
irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis· essem).
