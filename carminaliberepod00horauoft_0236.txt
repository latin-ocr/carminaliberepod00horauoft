magis, ‘louder than ever.'

sub interlunia, ‘at the change of moons,’ i-e. when there is no
moon. The ancients believed that this was the stormiest part of the
month. For the division of interlunia, cf. 1. 2. 19 n.

14. matres equorum, ‘mares.' For the periphrasis cf. olentis
uxores mariti in 1. 17. 7.

17. nubea, ‘young men,’ as in 11. 8. 17.

hedera...myrto. Take pulla myrto together. The sense is ‘youth

{lelights in bright-green ivy and dark—green myrtle more than in dry
eaves.

20. Euro, see Critical Note. Eurus is hiemis sodalis just as the
Thracian breezes are called veris comites in lv. 12. 1.

Ode ΧΧνΙ.

Scheme. A devotee of the Muses, I have no troubles and care
nothing for politics. Come then, dear Muse, and weave a garland for
my Lamia. He is worthy of a new, a Lesbian, ode.

It is not known who Lamia was, but 111. 17 is addressed to one
Aelius Lamia and in 1. 36. 7 a Lamia is spoken of as a school-friend of
Numida. There was a L. Aelius Lamia who was praefectus urbi in

A.D. 32 and died in Λα). 33. A scholiast speaks also osan Aelius Lamia
who wrote plays.

Metre. Alcaic. This is perhaps Horace’s first attempt in this metre
(see 11. 6 and ιο). It seems to have been written about ac. 30 (see l. 5).

1. musis amous, cf. 111. 4. 25 vestris amicum fontibus'et choris.
mantiam, cf. Ι. 7. 18.

α. in mare craneum, cf. 1. 1. 14n.

tradam portare. The infin. is explanatory. See Introd. p. xxiii.
Cf. Vergil's dederatque comam diffundere ventis (Aen. 1. 319), ‘ she gave
her hair to the winds for them to scatter.’

3. quis, nom. sing. ‘who is feared as king.’ (Some edd. however
take quis as dat. plur. sometimes spelt queis, ‘by whom.') The Romans

perhgapsgwere fearing an incursion of northern hordes (cf. ι. 19. 10 and
111. . 1 .

5. 'tiridates became king of Parthia for a short time in succession
to Phraates or Prahates IV., who was expelled. It seems that Tiridates
raised a rebellion against Phraates about B.c. 33, and after some unsuc-
cessful campaigns fled (B.c. 30) to Octavianus (then passing through
Syria after the battle of Actium). From Syria he afterwards made

another attempt and managed to expel Phraates in Rc. 27. Phraates,
however, recovered the throne early in B.c. 26. There are allusions to
the same events in 11. 2. 17 and 111. 8. 19.

unice, ‘ alone,’ though every one else is full os these topics.
