INTRODUCTION. xxiii

clause (with ut and the subj.) would be requiredl. Some
os the instances in Horace (e.g. certat tollere in 1. 1. 6, or
gaudet posuisse 1. 34 16, or tendentes imposuisse 111. 4. 52) can
be paralleled in prose, but the following are extremely bold:
pecus egit visere (1. 2. 8), coniurata rumpere and furit reperire
(1. 15. 7 and 27), te persequor frangere (1. 23. 10), tradam ventis
portare (1. 26. 3), laborat trepidare (11. 3. 1 1), urges summovere
(11. 18. 21), dedit spernere (11. 16. 39), impulerit maturare necem
(111. 7. 14—16)‚ me eapetz't urere (Epod. 11. 5).

The infinitive is similarly used with adjectives to Suggest a
purpose or consequence, or to limit the aspect of the epithet2:
as indocilis pati (1. 1. 18), callidus condere (1. 10. 7), blandus
ducere 1. 12. 11, 12), praesens tollere and dolosus ferre (1. 35. 2
and 28), leviora tolli (11. 4. 11), pertinax ludere (111. 29. 53),
effi'cax eluere (lv. 12. 2ο), veraces cecinisse (Carm. Saec. 25),
lubn‘cus aspici (1. 19. 8), niveus videri (1v. 2. 59), nefas videre
(Epod. 16. 14), nobilis superare (1. 12. 26), and dolens vinci(1v.
4. 62.)

It is obvious that, in many of these instances, a gerund with or
without a preposition might have been used. Horace, however,
regards the infinitive (in the Greek way) as an indeclinable noun. ⁴

Tbese constructions, though found in other Latin poets, are
specially characteristic of Horace; but, besides these, he has
many other and more common devices to procure that per-
petual quaintness which, as Aristotle said, is essential to
poetical diction.

3. 'With adjectives, he is partial to a kind of hypallage

¹ The Greek constructions imitated are such as ἀνὴρ χαλεπὸς συζῆν,
παρέχω ἐμαυτὸν τῷ ἰατρῷ τέμνειν, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι, λευκὸς ὁρᾶσθαι.

² In the instances above cited, grammarians would call some of the
infinitives prolate or complementary, others epexegettcal or explanatory.
The difference between the two kinds is briefly this: the prolate infin.
is necessary to limit the meaning of 'the preceding verb or adjective,
while the epexegetieal infin. is merely illustrative of the meaning. E.g.
celer irasci means ‘quick to anger,' not ‘quick at everything‚ anger
included,' whereas blandus ducere quercus does mean ‘ persuasive to

ermina, oaks inaudax
