NOTES. 341 ’

21. mos, one of the judges of Hades. (The others were Rhada-
manthus and Aeacus, 11. 13. 22.)

splendida arbiffla, ‘his august decision.’ The epithet is frequently
applied to oratory and probably refers here to Minos’ stately eloquence.

It may, however, mean ‘clear-voiced.’
23. genua, ‘noble birth’: cf. 1. 14. 13.
25. tenebris, with liberat, abl. of separation.

pudicum Hippolytum, an example ospietas‚ for the chaste Hippoly-
tus was a votary of Artemis (Diana). A different legend related that
Hippolytus was restored to life by Aesculapius (Aeneid vu. 765, Ovid

Met. κν. 479).

27. Theseus. The point lies in caro. Love too is powerless to
restore the dead. The example is suggested by the mention of Hip-
lytus‚ who was the son of Theseus 3 but Hor. ignores the legend that
δεῦε, though he could not rescue Pirithous from Hades, was himself
rescued by Heraclea. '

Ode vm.

To C. Marcius Censorinus, whotwas consul Rc. 8 and died Ad). 2.

He was of so obliging a disposition that Velleius Paterculus (11. 102) -
calls him vir demet-endis hominibus natus.

Scheme. Ι would gladly give my friends choice works of art, if 1
had them, and to you, Censorinus, I would give the best of any. But I
have them not nor do you require thern. You love poetry and poetry
is mine to give. Note well the value of it. Poetry, better than monu-
ments or tisses, can confer immortality and can exalt a hero to heaven. ι

So many obiections can be justly taken to ll. 13-24 that'it is im-
possible to think they are authentic. Two lines more (see critical note)
are probably also to be excised‚ though it is difficult to select two. The
remainder os the ode is unworthy of Horace, but some critics find faults
enough to rove that it could not have been written by a Roman at all.
Yet it has geen included in Hor-'s works since the and century.

Mem. First Asclepiad.

r. donarem. The protasis (si possem) can be supplied from 1. 5
divite me artium etc.

emona, ‘obliging’ The sense is reinforced by grata ‘delightfu1.’

2. mnis seems to have some emphasis, as if Horace wished to say
et ego donarem. Possibly Censorinus had sent Horace a work of art
sor a New Yoer's present. It was the custom at Rome to exchange

present: (strenae) at the Saturnalia <in December) and on the Kalends
of March. (The dat. sodalibus depends on donarem.)

aen, ‘bronze bowls,’ λέβητες, οι· other vases, ornamented with
chasing and repousse work. Such vessels were largely produced in
Corinth3 hence Ephyreia aera in Georg. 11. 464: cf. Sat. 11. 3. 21 and
