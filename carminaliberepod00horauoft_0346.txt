302 HORACE, ODES 111. xxi, xxii.

F rankness and hope and courage—these are thy gifts: Liber and Venus
and the Graces—-these are thy companions. With thee and thern we
will feast till daylight.

M. Valerius Messala Corvinus was at Athens with Horace in
B.c. 42 and joined the army of Brutus. Subsequently he joined
Octavian against Antony and commanded the centre of the Roman
fleet at Actium. He afterwards commanded in Aquitania and was
awarded a triumph in B.c. 27. He was a warm friend to literary men,
especially to Tibullus and Propertius. It appears, from Servius’ note
on Aeneid VI11. 31ο, that Maecenas wrote an imaginary conversation
(called Symposz‘um) in which Messala was represented as extolling the
virtues of wine. He is called disertus Messala in Ars Poet. 371.

Metre. Alcaic.

1. consule Manno. L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta
were consuls B.C. 65, the year of Horace’s birth. Cf. Epocle 13. 6 vina
· Torquato consule pressa meo. The date of the vintage was painted on
the amphora or on its label. 111. 8. 12 n.

. 2. querellas, ‘ complaints,' especially of the unsuccessful lover, as
m 11. 9. 19.

geris. The wine-jar ‘ carries ’ within it the springs of maudlin love
or sun or passion or sleep.

3. mammamores, cf. 1. 13. 9-12.
4. facilem, ‘ easily wooed ’ as in 11. 11. 8.

pia testa. The testa (i.e. earthenware amphora) is called pia
probably (as Kiessling suggests) because it fulfils the behests of
Bacchus, whatever they may be. Other editors think pia means ‘kind '
and refers only to the gift of facilem somnum. ·

5. quocumque nomine, with servas. ledum: ‘choice‚’ as Mr
Page points out. Massicum, cs. 1. 1. 19.

nomine, ‘in whatever behalf.' nomen is properly the ‘heading ’ os
an account in a ledger‚ then a bill or account itself, then generally the

purpose to which anything is referred. Cf. Tac. Ann. XIV. 59 decretae
eo nomine supplicationes.

6. moveri, ‘to be disturbed,‘ cf. 111. 20. 1 and Epode 13. 6 vina
move.

7. descende, from the apotheca on the roos. C'f. 111. 8. 1 1 n.
8. lang-maiora, ‘mellow‚’ cf. ΠΙ. 16. 35.

9. madet, ‘is steeped in.' There is a latent pun as Wickham
(quoting Munro) observes, for it is suggested that Corvinus is already
drunk with philosophy and might be expected to need no wine. For
madere in the sense of ‘ to be drunk‚·' cf. uvidus 11. 19. 18, lv. 5. 39.

Socraticis sermonibus, ‘ Socratic dialogues,' i.e. mainly the writings
of Plato, the chief pupil of Socrates (d. B.C. 399) and founder of the

Agademic School. (Cf. 1. 29· 14.) Horace did not belong to this
sc oo .

10. horridus, ‘like a boor': cf. Cic. Brut. 3¹· 117 ut vita sic
oratione durus, incultus, horridus. It would appear from such passages
