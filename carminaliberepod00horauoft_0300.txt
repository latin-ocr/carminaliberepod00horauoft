256 HORACE, ODES 11. xx.

His legs dwindle to the size of a bird’s, and the skin settles down and
becomes scaly.

13· Daedaleo Icaro. Icarus, son of Daedalus, was furnished by
his father with wings, which were fastened to his shoulders with wax.
Unfortunately‚ he soared too near the sun, which melted the wax, so
that he fell into the sea called, after him, Icarian. Cf. ιν. 2. 2-4.

On the reading see critical note.

Ruffles her pure cold plume and takes the flood
With swarthy webs.’

and Gaul shall learn me by heart. Some of the best writers of the 1st
century after Christ were born in Spain: e.g. both Senecas, Lucan,
Quintilian and Martia13 and Lyons (Lugdunum) on the Rhone became
a famous nursery of orators.

Some editors take peritus proleptically; ‘ the Spaniard shall study
{ne when he becomes leamed‚' or ‘shall study me so as to become
earned.’

20. Rhodam potor. Cf. 111. 10. 1 extremum Tanain si biberes,
Lyce, and 1v. 15. 21.

21. inani funere. funus is properly the burning of the corpse:
inane funus appears to mean the same thing as sunus imaginarium, a
funeral fire without a corpse, corresponding to our phrase ‘an empty
bier‚’ or ‘a cenotaph.' Horace imagines that he has disappeared and ’
that his friends, assuming him to be dead, hold funeral rites for him.
Cf. Aeneid vx. 505.

ἠπίη, ‘dirges' sung by the praeficae‚ women hired for the
purpose.

22. turpes, ‘ hideous,' ‘ disfiguring‚' because the mourners wore
black and the women tore their hair and scratched their faces.

23. clamorem seems to mean ‘ clamorous grief ’ generally, for the
conclamatio, or solemn calling on the dead, took place at the bedside.

24. mitte=omitte, as in Ι. 38. 3. Horace apparently does not .
resuse a funus, because his friends would regard this as a solemn duty,

lbuthe objects to the idle and expensive formalities of mourning and
uria .
