INTRODUCTION. xi

Academic opinions in moral philosophy, but professed himself
a free thinker inclined to Epicureanism 1.

During his stay at Athens, Horace made the acquaintance
of many young Romans of noble birth2, by whom apparently he
was introduced, in September B.c. 44, to M. Junius Brutus³,
the Liberator. Brutus, at this time, was passing through
Athens on his way to the province of Macedonia which had
been assigned to him (as propraetor) by Julius Caesar before
his murder. (Cassius meanwhile was proceeding to his province,
Syria.) As governor of Macedonia, Brutus was collecting an
army, partly to oppose C. Antonius, who claimed the province
as nominee of the senate, and partly to combat some turbulent
tribes of Thracians, who were harassing the borders. In this
army, Horace received the appointment of military tribune4.
He marched with the troops through Macedonia and Thrace,
crossed the Hellespont, saw a good deal of Asia Minor⁵ and
returned with the combined forces of Brutus and Cassius to the
field of Philippi (Nov. B.C. 42). In the first battle at this place,
Brutus was victorious; in the second (twenty days later) he
was defeated, and Horace fledss, never to bear arms again.

¹ Epist. 1. 1. ¹4 (nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri), and
Epist. Ι. 4. 16 (Epicuri de grege porcum). Cf. also Carm. Ι. 34. 1—5.

² Some of them are named in Sat. 1. ro. 81—87.

⁸ Plutarch, Brutus, 24.

⁴ Sat. 1. 6. 48 (quod milti pareret legio Romana tribuno). The
statement here is doubtless an exaggeration, for there should have been
six tribunes to the legion.
’ ⁸ It is clear that Horace was at Clazomenae and saw the trial
described in Sat. 1. 7. The rest of his campaigning, before Philippi, is
mere matter of inference. He speaks of Thrace in winter (e.g. Carm. 1.
37. 20) and of the Hellespont (Epist. 1. 3. 4) as if he had seen them, and
he addresses a friend (Carm. 11. 7. 1, α) as ‘ 0 saepe mecum tempus.
in ultimum Ι deducte Bruto militiae duce.’

⁸ Carm. Π. 7. 9, 10 (tecum Philippos et celerem sugam Ι sensi,
relicta non bene parmula). Cf. also Carm. πη. 4. 26. ln Epod. 1. 16
(written ten years later than Philippi) he describes himself as imbellis
acfinmae parum.
