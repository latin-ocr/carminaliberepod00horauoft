NOTES. 315

²4· ripas, ‘sea-shore’ as in ΙΙ. 18. 22.

Kiessling calls attention to the repetition of r (nine times) in orientis
—r ipas. No doubt this is intended to suggest the growling of the
storm. The Latin r (called littera canina) was strongly trilled.

2 5. dc, ‘like you,’ et credidit et (postea) palluit.

Europe, daughter of Phoenix, while gathering flowers, was approached
by a white bull. As it seemed to be a gentle animal, she mounted on
its back‚· but it rushed away with her and carried her across the sea to

Crete. ΤΙιε bull was Zeus.

26. scatentem beluis, cf. beluosus oceanus 1v. ¹4· 47, and the
·monstra natantia of 1. 3. 18.

²7· medias mudes, ‘the deceits that beset her.’ She did not
perceive them till she was in the middle of them.

28. audax, ‘for all her boldness.’ For palluit with accus. ef.
Epist. 1. 3. 10 Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus.

29. nuper studiosa, ‘ she who was but lately intent on flowers.'

3¹· sublustri, ‘ glimmering.'

33. eentum pot. opp. Homer's Κρήτη ἑκατόμπολις, translated
in Epod. 9. 29 by centum nobilem urbibus. simul :simul ac.

35. filiae. Many edd. take filiae as dat„ and nomen in apposition
to pater: ‘F ather, O name abandoned by thy daughter,’ and this is
probably right. But pater is possibly a cry for help, in effect: ‘ F ather,
why did 1 abandon the name of daughter and suffer my duty to be

overcome by my passion.’

37. unde quo veni ⁴1 The two questions whence and wkither are
combined in the Greek manner: πόθεν ποῖ ἐλήλυθα; The cry is
perhaps one of mere bewilderment, cf. Aeneid x. 670 where Turnus,
when suddenly carried out to sea, eries quo feror? unde abii? quae me
suga quemve reducet? But more probably unde quo veni means ‘ from
what a happy home to what a strange shore am Ι come 1’

lovi! m mors est. ‘A single death is a light punishment-³ Cf.
Propertius v. 4. 17 et satis una malae poterit mors esse puellae.

39. vitus mentem, ‘innocent.’

41. porta...ebnrna. In Odyssey xlx. 562 Homer says that there
are two gates in Hades from which dreams issue. The one is made of
horn, the other of ivory. Those dreams which issue from the former
come true: those which issue from the ivory gate are baseless. ‘ Am I
awake and weeping for a disgracesul sin, or am I innocent, mocked
gy an? idle vision that, issuing from the ivory gate} brings but a

ream ’

4²· meliusne, in effect: ‘could 1 choose rather)
47. enitar, subj. ⁴ 1 would strive.'
modo multum amati, ‘that lately was so dear.’

50. Orcum moror, ‘ 1 keep Death waiting’: Orcus being a person,
as usual in Hor. (see 11. 18. 34).
