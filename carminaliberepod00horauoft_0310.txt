266 HORACE, oDEs 111. iii.

25. Lacaenae adulterae, dat. to splendet, as in 1. 5. 12 misen·
quibus nites. ‘ No longer does her insamous guest shine in the eyes of
the Spartan adulteress.' For hospes cf. hospitam in 1. 15. 2.

28. Hectoreis opibus, ‘ by the aid of Hector.' The sing. would be
more usual, as in ope Daedalea lv. 2. 2.

29. nostris...sed1t10n1bus. ‘The war protracted by our quarrels':
for Mars, Apollo and Venus fought on the side of the Trojans, while
Juno, Minerva and Neptune were against them.

30. protinus, ‘ henceforth. ’

31· nepotem, ‘my grandson.’ Romulus was the son of Mars, and
therefore the grandson of Juno.

3²· Troica...sacerdos. Rea Silvia, the vestal. She is called
Troica because Horace (as in 1. α. 17) identifies her with Ilia, the
daughter of Aeneas.

33. redonabo. This verb is used by Horace alone (in a different
sense, 11. 7. 3). Here it is equivalent to condonabo. ‘ Ι will forgive
Mars my causes of anger and my hated grandson? Cf. Caesar B. G. 1.
20 praeterita se Divitiae-0 fratri condonare dicit.

36. ordinibus, dat. as in Tac. Hist. 11. 94 urbanae militiae adscri-
bebatur. There were distinctions of rank among the gods, as di maiores
and minores. The epithet quietis is a piece of Epicureanism (see 1. 34. ·
2 n.)‚ quite inappropriate here.

38. exules, the Trojan exiles, Aeneas and his offspring.
‘legg’ ‘Pxffl' abl., for insultet is used in its etymological sense of
Ἰῒ43ζ. fulgens. The roof of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was
1 .
g triumphans. Cf. Georgic 111. 33 bisque triumphatas utroque ab
litore gentes. possit, ‘ have the power to.'

45. late, with horrenda ε ‘feared far and wide.’

nomen, practically ‘her sway,' sor nomen=nationa1ity, as Latinum
nomen 1v. 15. 13.
46. medius liquor, ‘the intervening sea’ i.e. the Straits of Gibraltar‚

between Spain and the province of Afrioe. This is the boundary of the
West, as the Nile is the boundary of the East.

50. fortior. This is the condition precedent to tanget* armis in
l. 54. ‘If she be braver in despising gold, undiscovered and all the
better placed when hidden in the earth, than in compelling it to human
use with hands that snatch at everything sacred, then shall she reach
with her arms every boundary of the world ' etc.

51. cogere may moen ‘ to collectss in which case humanos in usus
belongs to rapiente.
54. gestiens, ‘ exulting to see with her own eyes!

55. ignes, the torrid zone. nebulae...rom, the aretin: regions.
See Vergil Georgic 1. 234—235.
