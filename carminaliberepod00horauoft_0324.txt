280 HORACE, oDEs 111. vii, viii.

Ode vn.

Scheme. Why weep, Asterie, for Gyges, who will come back to
you in the spring, laden with wealth and as loving as ever? He has
been driven by storms into Oricus. His hostess loves him and tries to
win his beart, but he is ever loyal to you. And you? Is not your
neighbour Enipeus, that handsome athlete, becoming a little dangerous?

Mind you shut your door of a night and do not look out of window
when you hear his serenades.

of the preceding (cf. the final stanza of 11. 1).
