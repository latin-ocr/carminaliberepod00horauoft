xxviii INTRODUCTION.

The metrical scheme is :
1, 2. Ξ - μ - - ‚ - υ υ - υ v (eleven syllables).

. Ξ - υ - - - υ - ῦ (nine syllables).

4. - υυ - vu -— υ - v (ten syllables).

The first two lines begin with a short syllable only 18 times
(out of 634 examples) ¹.

The diaeresis (which was not used by the Greeks) after the
fifth syllable is neglected in 1. 16. 21: 37. 5: 37. 14: 11. 17. 21:
1v. 14. 17. Elision occurs at the diaeresis in 111. 1. 5: 4 49. The
fifth syllable is short in 111. 5. 17: and possibly 111. 23. 18.

In the third line, the first syllable is short only 10 times in
317 examples. The fifth syllable is, in Horace, always long,

· though in Alcaeus it appears to have been always short. A

most important rule in the construction of this line is that it
shall not end with two dissyllabic words. Such an ending
occurs only 8 tirneS, viz. 1. 16.4: 26. 7: 29. 11 : 11. 1. 11: 13. 27:
14. 11 : 19. 7: 19. 11 : and in 5 of these eight instance5‚ the first
dissyllable is repeated at the beginning of the next line (e.g. 11.
13. 27 dura navis Ι dura fugae mala).

In the fourth line, there is usually caesura after the fourth
syllable, but the main rule is that the line shall not begin with
two trisyllabic words (e.g. tristia tempora).

Synapheia of the third and fourth lines occurs in 11. 3. 27:
111. ²9· 35, but is conspicuously neglected in 1. 16. 27: 17. 13:
11. 13. 7. Yet, on the whole, synapheia is usually respected.
‘An Alcaic line does not often end with a short vowel, even
when the next line begins with a consonant.' (Ramsay, Latin
Prosody, p. 212.)

The original rhythm, according to Dr Schmidt, was:

1‚2. JldsslAJIJJJIJJl-lw
³·J'10'0NJJ'10'JIJJ*
4 ,Γ-ΣΣΙΦῚῈΣΙΔΤΙΔΓ.

² In the IVth Book, the opening syllable is always long.
