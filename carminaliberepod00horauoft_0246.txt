202 HORAcE‚ ODEs 1. xxxii, xxxiii.

siquid. A humble manner of suggesting that the poet had received
similar favours before. Cf. Carm. Saec. 37 Roma sivestrum opus est etc.:

Verg. Georg. 1. 17 tua si tibi Maenala curae, Adsis, O Tegeaee, favens.

vacui, not ‘in an idle hour,' but ‘fancy-free’ as in Ι. 6. 19. The
allusion is to such poems as Ι. 26 or 27.

2. lusimus, with acc. cf. xv. 9. 9 siquid olim lusit Anacreon.

quod...p1m-1s. Kiessling, to some extent following Bentley, takes
Latinum carmen to be the antecedent of uod, ‘a Latin ode that may
live.’ But apart from the ungainliness o such Latin, the adjuration
loses force. ‘ Sing an immortal song, for we have sung together before’

is not so effective as ‘Sing a song, for we have sung immortal songs
together ere now.’

3. dic. Cf. 1. 17. 19 and 111. 4. 1.

4. barbito. This word, which is pure Greek, and Lesbio in 1. 5
throw emphasis, by contrast, on Latinum.

5. Lesbio civi, Alcaeus, who is called civis perhaps to indicate
his political activity against the tyrants Myrsilus and Pittacus.

modulate is passive. Cf. Ι. 1. 25 n.
6. ferox bello, ‘though spirited in war.’ Cf. 11. 13. 36 and 1v. 9. 7.
7. sive, ‘ or if,' as in 1. 6. 19.

ι t 'eff-3²3²& ‘ had tied up’ as in 1. 5. 4. N.B. relegare sometimes means
o un ie.

udo, wet with the same storrn that tossed the ship.

9. mi...na.erentem, ‘ cleaving to her side’ as in Aeneid x. 780
missus ab Argis haeserat Evandro.

11. nigris..,deoorum. Cf. Ars Poet. 37 spectandum m'gris oculis
nigroque capillo.

13· decus Phoebi. Cf. 1. 21. 12.

15. mihi...vocanti. These words seem to mean ‘be gracious to
me always when I duly call thee.’

cumque. In previous od& (see 1. 6. 3 n.) we have had many
examples of tmesis in quicum ue and it is possible that Horace regarded
cumque as a separate word re ated to quisque as cum is to qui. It would
mean ‘ ever‚’ i.e. ‘ always' or ‘ at any time.’ No‘ doubt cumque was
at one time a separate word (like quandoque), but it is not found by itself
elsewhere. .

salve, which is ordinarily a formula of greeting or farewell, is
sometimes rather a formula of worship. In this use, it may be a version
of the Greek ἵληθι ‘be gracious' (as Dr H. Jackson suggests). If so,
then salve mihi rite vocanti is a legitimate expression: cf. the Publican's
prayer in Luke xviii. 13¹ ὁ θεὸς ἱλάσθητί μοι τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ. The nearest
parallels are Verg. Georg. 11. 173 and Aen. VIII. 301, where a hymn to
Hercules ends with Salve, vera Iovis proles, decus addite divis Et nos et
tua dexter adi pede sacra secundo.
