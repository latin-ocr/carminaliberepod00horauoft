XX INTRODUCTION.

conspicuously seen, to wander into mythology may be noticed
too in many οξ the shorter pieces (e.g. Carm. Ι. 7, 18: 11. 4, 13:
111. 17: 1v. 6). It should be remembered, however, that, in an
· ode of Pindar, composed for a religious and patriotic festival, a
fine local myth, showing forth ‘the glories of our birth and
state‚’ was especially appropriate ; and that moralizing too was,
in Pindar's day, as much expected of the poet as fine images
and musical rhythms. He was the popular philosopher, the
seer who could discern the tendencies of men's actions and
could pronounce upon them with due blame or praise.

Horace derived, then, from his Greek models a certain
discursiveness in his treatment of a theme. He took from
them also an extreme ‘abruptness' of manner, such that it is
often difficult to follow the train of his thoughts (see, for
instance, 1. 7 or 11. 2 or 111. 4 or lv. 9). This abruptness is due
partly to the brevity of his diction and partly to a literary con·
vention. As the poet Gray wrote to his friend Mason, ‘extreme
conciseness of expression, yet pure, perspicuous and musical, is
one of the great beauties of lyric poetry.’ And the reason is
obvious. In short lines, with a marked rhythmical beat, almost
every word becomes emphatic and must deserve to be emphatic.
This conciseness necessarily leads to abruptness of thought, for
the conjunctions and brief explanatory phrases which, in a sreer
style of composition, serve to mark the connexion of ideas,
are excluded from lyrics by their unemphatic character. It is a
convention also, between poets and their audience, that lyrics,
however elaborate, should profess to be written on the inspira-
tion of the moment, and should therefore seem to be hurried,
unpremeditated, unmethodical. They are spoilt if they become
argumentative.

In real inspiration Horace was probably deficient. Certainly

was sent back to earth and, by help of Poseidon, he won Hippodamia
to wife in a chariot·race at Olympia.

150—160. From that time forth the glory of the Olympian races
has shone abroad.
