292 HORACE, ODES 111. xiv, xv.

jerky and the diction in places unusual. Many editors therefore believe
the ode to be an interpolation.

Metre. Sapphic.

1. Herculis ritu, ‘like Hercules,’ qualifying petiisse. ‘Caesar,.
who was lately said to have sought‚ like Hercules, a laurel to be won
only by death.’ Augustus was very ill and nearly died at Tarraco in
B.c. 25.

For ritu cf. Ars Poet. 62 iuvenum ritu florent.

ο plebs. There is, as Wickham remarks, no parallel to this use of
plebs for the whole Roman people, high and low together.

2. morte venalem, cf. 11. 16. 7. The sense would be the same
with vita instead of morte3 cf. Aeneid lx. ‘206 qui vita bene credat
emi, quo tendis, honorem.

5. mulier, Livia, wife of Augustus. unicus may mean either
‘single ’ or ‘unparalleled ' and Horace happens to use it in both senses:
the former in 11. 18. 14, the latter in 1. 26. 5. The latter sense, ‘peet-
less‚’ is more probable here. Orelli and Wickham suggest that ‘re-
'jssffiissieisshffirrffifiss‘issuflssssnssussssssffii‘teli'ssssiiff {¹1¹5 ἳῖἷυὲωξέ {¹ ‘³ ὅῖοέῗὲὶ
she rejoice in hJer husband alone and not in any other logers? Either
way, this is a lame compliment to Livia.

6. iustis divis. The gods had shown their justice by giving -
Caesar the victory.

operata, ‘ after sacrificing’ on the family altar. Cf. Cereri operatus
in Vergil, Georg. Ι. 339.

7. soror, Octavia, the neglected wife of Antony. She died B.c.
11.

8. supplice vitta. The vitta was a ribbon worn round the head
by matrons. A supplex vitta seems to be the same ribbon, twined with
flocks of red and white wool (infula), and worn at festal sacrifices. The
day was a supplicatio or ‘ thanksgiving. ’

ro. sospitum belongs to virginum as well as to iuvenum. The
virgines share in the protection vouchsafetho their betrothed. '

pueri et puellae. These are the noisiest part of the crowd: cf.
fat. 31⁵. 3. 130 insanum te omnes pueri clamentque puellae: also Sat.

11. virum, emphatic, the ideal man, the man of virtus as Epod.
15. 12. ·

ι 3. vere mim festus, ‘ a real holiday to me.'

14. eximet. The variant exiget is supported by xv. 15. 17-21.

17. puer. For the sudden address to the slave cf. 1. 19. 14, 11. 7. 23.

18. Marsi duelli. The Social war B.C. 91—88. The wine would
not only be very old and mellow but would also remind the drinkers of
the horrors to which Augustus had now happily put an end.
