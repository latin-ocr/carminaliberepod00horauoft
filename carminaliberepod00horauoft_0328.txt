ode ΙΧ.

This famous piece is a dialogue, carmen amoebaeum, in four-line
stanzas, between two lovers parted by a quarrel. The man is usually
supposed to be Horace himself, as in the well-known lines of Prior (d.
1721):

‘Then finish, Dear Cloe, this Pastoral War;
And let us like Horace and Lydia agree:

For Thou art a Girl as much brighter than Her,
As He was a Poet sublimer than Me.’

The scheme of the dialogue' 1s as follows:

He. While you were faithful I was as happy as a king.

S.lce 'Twas you began it by courting Chloe.

He. 1 love her and would die for her. 1 can be constant if Ι
εὴοὲῗέ. So can 1 too. I would die twice for my Calais.

Hc. What if our first love were to return and Chloe were dis-
missed, and Lydia free?
