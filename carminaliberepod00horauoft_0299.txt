Ode ΧΧ.
To Maecenas.

Scheme. 1 shall soar away on majestic pinions, Maecenas. Humble
as 1 am, 1 shall not die. I feel myself changing into a bird and I shall
fly to the uttermost parts os the earth, that all peoples may know me.
When I am gone, let there be no idle tears or dirges or tomb for me.

The ode is an epilogue to the Second Book, expressing, by an
allegory, the poet's conviction that his writings had won him immor-

tality. He wssl dmppear, he says, but he will not die.

Mare. Alcaic-

ι. non usitata, ‘ not usual,' because Horace was princeps Aeolium
cumen ad Italos Deduxisse modos (111. 30. 13, 14).

ἰ- usumin vatos, ‘a bard transformed.’ Horace like Pindar

(cf. ιν. 2. 25) is a man who, by poesy, can become a swan. He will
not die: he will assume his swanfform and soar away into the heavens.
The metaphor, by which a poet is,ca11ed a swan or an eagle or any
other kind of bird, is treated as a matter of fact and becomes an

’ allegory: just as in 1. 14 the metaphor of ‘ the ship of state' is treated

as matter os fact.
4. invidia mador, ⁴ triumphant over envy.'

5. pauperum anguls parentum. This explains invidia maior.
In Sat. ι. 6. 46 Horace speaks of himself as one quem rodunt omnes
tivertino patre natum Nunc quia sim tibi, Maecenas, convictor, at
alin Quod mihi pareret legio Romana tribuno. The envious carped at
Homoe because, though os most ignoble birth, he was admitted to the
inmo-t circle of Maecenas’ friends.

6. qm m, ‘who (they say) am at your beck and call.' The
euvinus twit Horace with his mean birth, and also with his frequent
invitations to Maecenas’s table, as if he were a mere parasite. For voco
in this sense es. ιιι. 6. 30, and see Lewis and Short, voco Β. Ι. and
matio. The favourite ex lanation of this passage takes dilecte with
vocas: ⁴1, whom you cal dilecte! But this, even if it were Latin,
would not be good sense. Some term of reproach, similar to pauperum
sex-ngat) parentum, is absolutely required, to account for the repetition
o nou e o. ⁴ —

open to the same objection as the last and is also effectually contra-
dacted by the words non obibo.

7. duecte. 'l'here is a special point in the epithet‚ as showing
both that the charge of parasitism was a calumny and that Horace
could endure it out os his love sor Maecenas.

9. hm iam. Horace seels the metamorphosis beginning.
