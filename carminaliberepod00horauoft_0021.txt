INTRODUCTION. xvii

world. (2) No ode in the first three Books points clearly to a
later date than B.C. 24. On the other hand, there are odes in
all three Books which refer to this and earlier dates. Thus
111. 14 relates to the return of Augustus from Spain: Ι. 24 to
the death of Quintilius: and 1. 29 to the expedition of Aelius
Gallus into Arabia: All these events happened ‚in B.C. ²4.·
11. 4 was written near the en'd of Horace's fortieth year, i.e.
B.C. 25. 1. 31, 11. 15 and 111. 6 seem all to refer to the restora-
tion of temples which occupied Augustus in B.C. 28. It is
obvious that these odes could have been published together.
(3) The first Book cannot have been published before B.C. 24,
for it refers, as we have just seen, to events of that year. If
the second and third Books were written (in part) and published
later, why does Horace, about B.C. 20 (see Epist. 1. 1. 1—10),
speak as if he had long given up the practice of writing lyrics
and could not resume it?

1f, then, we assume that the first three Books were published
together, they must have been published late in B.C. 24 or early
in B.C. 23. This date is inserted from the fact that Marcellus,
the nephew and adopted son of Augustus, is referred to as the
hope of the Caesarian house in Carm. Ι. 12. 45—483 and Lici-
nius Murena, brother-in-law of Maecenas, is addressed in Carm.
11. 10 and referred to as living in 111. 19. Marcellus died in the
autumn of B.C. 23, and Murena was executed for conspiracy in
B.C. 22. It is not likely that Horace published these references
to them after their deaths.

The only other dates proposed are B.C. 19 and B.C. 22. The
former date is suggested because 1. 3 is supposed to refer to
the voyage which Vergil took, to Greece, early in B.C. 193 and
other odes, especially 11. 9, are thought to refer to the expedi-
tion into Armenia of B.C. 20. The date of 11. 9, however, seems
to be fixed to the end of B.C. 25, or the beginning of 24, by
the allusion to tropaea Augusti Caesaris, a grand monument
so called, voted by the Senate in B.C. 25. (See the concluding
note on 11. 9.) As to 1. 3, it is likely that this ode does not

refer to Vergil's last voyage to Greece, for it says nothing about
Vergil’s ill-health.
