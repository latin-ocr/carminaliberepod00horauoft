Babylonios, more generally called Chaldaeos. The ancient Chal-
daeans were the first astronomers and we inherit from them the division
of the circle into 360 degrees and of the hour into 60 minutes. In later
times they were noted chiefly as astrologers, who pretended to under-
stand the influence of the stars on human destiny. They had a large
following in Rome and under the empire frequent attempts were made
to put them down. Horace himself was not free from the superstition
which he here decries. In 11. 17. 21 he tells Maecenas utrumque
nostrum incredibili modo consentit astrum.

the apodoms to seu...seu. The advice is similar to that m 1. 9. 13 sqq.

liques, ‘strain‚’ through a strainer (colum) or linen.

spatio brevi, abl. abs. ‘the time being short’: cf. Livy ιν. 4¹· η.
But some edd. incline to take it as dative=in breve spatium, something
like Vergil's it caelo clamor. (Introd. p. xxiv.)

dum loquimur, ‘we are wasting time even by talking‚’ cf. Ovid
Am. Ι. 11. 15 dum loquor, horasugit.
