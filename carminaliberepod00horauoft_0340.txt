Ode xvn.

Dedzcatz'on. To Aelius Lamia, who is perhaps the same person
that 1s mentioned m 1. 26. 8, 1. 365 7 and in Epzssst 1. 14 ..6 L. Aelius
Lamia was consul Α. D. 3 and it is commonly thought4 that he is here
· addressed. He was probably the son of Cicero’s friend Lamia, a very
rich banker who took an active part in tting down the Catilinarian
conspiracy The family 1s not heard of gesore this time and perhaps,
as they grew neh and powerful, they invented for themselves a spurious
pedigree‚ to which Horace playfully alludes m 11.1-9.

There are, however, great difficulties about connecting this Lamia
with the consul of Α. D. 3. He must have been very young at the date
of this ode, for he did not die till A. D. 33 and was praefectus urbi in
A.D. 32. Moreover, rich men do not generally relish jokes on their
pedigree, and the injunction aridum compone lngnum is not such as is
likely to have been addressed to a rich man.

If we read the poem without any prepossessions and attempt to find
some unity in the thoughts, the following seems to be the scheme of it z
‘Aelius, you must be descended from some Lamus and doubtless from
him who ruled over Formiae. To-morrow will be wet, and to·m0rrow
is the day of your Genius: so get in your dry wood to-day.' It would
seem that ‘to-morrow' was a day celebrated in Formiae as its dies
natalicius (like the Parilia, 21st April, at Rome).

Metre. Alcaic.

α. hinc, i.e. from Lamus (cf. hinc populum late regem etc. in
Aeneid 1. 21). The town of Lamia in Thessaly was said to have been
so called from one Lamus or Lamius‚ a son of Herakles. ‘Aelius‚ of
noble descent from ancient Lamus—for' tis· said that all the ancient
Lamiae and consequently their descendants through all time derive
their name from him—3

5. ducis. ‘You must derive your origin from him' etc. The
explanation is necessary, as there was more than one Lamus. See on
1. 2. For auctore of the founder of a family cf. 1. 2. 36. The Lamus
of Formiae was king of the Laestrygones z cf. 111. 16. 34.
