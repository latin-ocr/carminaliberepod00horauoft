CARMEN SAECULARE.

An ode written, by command of Augustus, to be sung in public
at the Ludi Saeculares, a grand religious ceremony intended to celebrate
the inauguration of the new regime. The proposal to hold such a
celebration was first made in 13.c. 23, but it was not carried out till the
summer of B.c. 17. Augustus, anxious as usual to give his innovations
the sanction of old tradition, revived for the occasion the Ludi Terentina·
(or Tarentini) which had been held in B-C. 249 and 146, and which

entmsted to the Χ Vviri sacris faciundis (who had charge of the
Sibylline books) with the assistance of Ateius Capito, a learned
antiquar-ian. ΤΙιε scope of the ceremony was, however, greatly en-
larged. The Ludi Terentini were a festival for the propitiation of Pluto
and Proserpine, held in Τ creatum, a corner of the Campus Martius,
where there seems to have been a warm spring. The Ludi Saeculares,
however, were largely devoted to heavenly (not infernal) denies,
especially Apollo and Diana.

A description of the celebration is given by Zosimus (11. 5), a

, historiari of the 5th century, but a more authentic and exact account

has been lately discovered. In Sept. 1890, during the excavations
sor the new embankment of the Tiber, large fragments were
found an inscribed column. set up by order of Augustus as a record
os the ceremonia observed at the Ludi Saeculares. The inscription
(printed with notes by Mommsen in Monumenti Anticlea· 1891 p. 618
.) contains a letter os Augustus to the XVviri, two decrees of the
viri and the order of proceedings. The festival began on the
night of May 31st nc. 17 and lasted 3 nights and 3 days. Sacrifices
were offered, on the ist night to the Moirai, on the and to the Ilithyiai,
on the 3rd to Terra Mater (Ceres): on the ist day (June 1st) to Juppiter
on the Ca ‘tol‚ on the 2nd to uno Regina, on the 3rd to Apollo and
Diana. agustus alone offer the prayers and sacrifices at night, but
he was joined 'by Aff'ssp‘ in the ceremonies of the daytime. That part
os the inscription w ic relates to this ode belongs to the description os
the proceedings on the 3rd day, and runs as follows ε
