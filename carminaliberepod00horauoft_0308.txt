264 HORACE, ODES 111. ii, iii.

integrum, ‘unspotted' (1. 22. ι), ‘innocent.’
31. scelestum, ‘miscreant.’

32. pede claudo, descriptive abl. with Poena: ‘Punishment with
her lame foot,’ called by Aeschylus ὑστερόποινος ''A-ra. The idea of the
lame foot seems, like everything else in the stanza, to be borrowed from
the Greek, but is not found in any extant Greek poem.

Ode ΙΙΙ.

Schema. The man of fortitude can be moved from his resolve by
no terror. It was fortitude that raised Pollux, and other heroes, to
immortality. Romulus was admitted to the circle of the immortals
only by express permission of Juno, who waived, for his sake, her long
hostilityvto the Trojan race. But she waived it, nevertheless, on one
condition, namely, that Troy should never be rebuilt. On this condi-
tion the stability of the Roman empire depends.

The ode is connected, by its opening stanzas, with the 6th stanza of
the preceding, but the gist of it is generally believed to be in the pro-
hibition against any revival of Troy. This may be taken literally, as
by Mommsen, who believes (see on l. 60) that schemes were really
mooted for shifting the centre of government from Rome to the East,
or creating an Eastern capital at Byzantium. Many editors, however,
regard the speech of Juno as allegorical‚ Troy representing either the
old Rome of the optimates, fallen never to be restored, or Asiatic
luxury, which, lately introduced, Augustus was determined to repress.

1. iustum...v1rum, ‘the man of just and firm resolve! Three
distinct ideas are combined : vir is the man of virtus, the brave man:
iustum means one who keeps his promises: tenacem propositi means
one who pursues his ends, without fear or favour. The second of these
three is especially prominent in the speech of Juno ll. 18-68. It was
by a breach of saith that Troy fell: it would be a breach of saith to
restore the fallen city. For vir cf. Cic. Milo 82 proposita invidia,
morte, poena, qui nihilo segnius rem publicam defendit, is vir vere
putandus est.

3. vultus, ‘glare,’ as in Ι. 2. 40 acer Mauri peditis cruentum
Vultus in hostem.

4. mente solida, abl. of the part concerned (Roby L. G. ἕ 1210):
‘ in his massy intent.' Wickham translates solida ⁶ rock-like.'

5. dux Hadriae: cf. arbiter Hadriae in 1. 3. 15. Mommsen
{igtgigsxtls that the Hadria is mentioned to recall Augustus’s exploits at

7. orbis, the dorne of heaven. Cf. 1. 16. 11 tremendo Iuppiter ,
ipse ruens tumultu.

8. ferient. This sorrn of apodosis, in which an unconditional
prophecy is substituted for a conditional statement, is very uncommon
(Roby L. G. §1574‚ 2). Cf. Ovid Tristia 11. 333 At si me iubeas
domitos Iovis igne gigantas Dicere, conantem debilitabit onus.

9. hae arte, ‘by this virtue.’ So Cicero Pro Lege Manilia ¹3· 36
