374 HORACE‚ EPODE v.

Adriatic coast, but she was so constant a companion of Canidia that
the gossips of N aples declare she must have been present on this
occaslon.

45. excantata, ‘ removed by enchantment.’

Thessala, i.e. magicalz cf. Carm. 1. 27. 21. ‘In any country an
isolated or outlying race, the lingering survivor of an older nationality‚
‘is liable to the imputation of sorcery.’ (Tylor, Pm‘mitive Culture
1. p. 113, where many examples are given. Gipsies‚ for instance, are
still believed to be adepts at fortune-telling.)

46. lunam, cf. Verg. Ecl. 8. 69 caelo deducere lunam.

47. mesenum, ‘long-nailed.' saeva seems to mean ‘furious’
with rage at Varus’ neglect of her.

. 49. quid...taeu1t. The expression seems to be proverbial for un·
brrdled outpourmg of words ε cf. Epist. 1. 7. 72 dicenda tacenda locutus.

50. athima, ‘witnesses' and so accomplices. Cf. Q. Curtius 111.
12. 9 secretorum omnium arbiter.

51. mana, invoked as moon-goddess, Hecate. Cf. Medea's in·
vocation in Ovid Metam. vn. 192 Nox, ait, arcanis fidissima... Tuque,
triceps Hecate, quae coeptis conscia nostris Adiutrixque venis.

5 3. hostius domos, either the house of my enemy, Varus, or the
houses of my rivals.

55. formidulosis, ‘ awful ’ in the darkness.

57. senem adulterum, i.e. my faithless old lover: cf. moechos in
the same sense in earm. 1. 25. 9. Prof. Housman, reading latrant
sor latrent in 1. 58, has greatly relieved the obscurity os this passage.
There is a pause after l. 56: Canidia then hears the dogs barking and
feels sure that they are barking at her lover who is on the prowl after
some other woman. In quod omn. rideant the verb is a consecutive
subj„ but it is doubtful whether the old man’s folly, or Canidia's failure
to hold him, is the ‘ meet subject sor laughter.’ On nardo see l. 61 n.

58. latrant, with accus„ as Sat. 11. 1. 86.

Suburanae. The Subura was a very busy but disreputable street,
leading to the Forum from the east.

59. quale...perreetius. This is a faulty construction for quali
non perfidius. Horace uses it again in Sat. 1. 5. 41 animae quales
neque candidiores Terra tulit.

61. quid accidit? The nardus, with which the old man reeks,
is a magic ointment (applied to his bed-clothes seemingly, cf. l. 69)
intended to act as a philtre or love-charm. It has quite failed.

minus valent. ‘ Why are they not strong enough 't' ’ But the next
four lines are grossly incongruous, for it was no philtre that Medea sent
to Creusa. Dr Postgate proposes to read magis...valent: ‘Why were
Medea’s drugs stronger than mineP’

69. indormit, literally ‘ He sleeps on a couch smeared with
oblivion of all concubines.’ Canidia has smeared Varus’ bed with a
dmg that will make him forget other women. She has combined
forces of attraction to herself and repulsion from her rivals.
