Ode ΙΙ.

The ode is addressed to Caesar (Octavianus, not yet Augustus), but
the date is uncertain. It was written, obviously, in winter after snow-
storms and floods (vv. 1—20), at a time when Caesar was in Rome
(v. 46) and when there seemed no reason why he should go away.
There were two occasions when he was received in Rome with special
exultationi: the first, in Nov„ 13.c. 36, after conquering S. Pompeius:
the second, in July, ΒΕ. 29, after conquering Antony and Cleopatra. In
August of the- latter year he celebrated a splendid triumph, to which

mant to surrender all his powers to the senate on Jan. rst, B.c. 27.
The announcement would naturally cause such alarm as is expressed in
this ode. 1t might therefore have been written in Dect. B.c. 28. Dion
Cassius (un. 20) expressly mentions a great flood in Rome about Jan.,
mc. 27, but by that time the litical alarin was over, for the senate
had given to Octavian imperi powers. N evertheless‚ the winter of
u-c. ἰδ-17 seems, on the whole, the most probable date for the compo-
sition os the ode. A very fine passage, of much the same tenour as this
ode, occurs at the end os Vergil's F irst Georgic, which seems to have
been written in mc. 32, a short time before the battle of Actium.
