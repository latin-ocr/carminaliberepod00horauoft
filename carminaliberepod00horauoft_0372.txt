328' HORACE, oDEs 1v. ii, iii.

began the ode at 1. 25 and added 11. 1—24 afterwards. In any case,
concines of l. 33 would be abrupt and obscure, unless some form of address
had lately preceded. ·

27. tractus, ‘expanses’: cf. caeli tractus in Aen. 111. 138.

apis. The comparison of poets to bees is common in Greek litera-
ture. Sophocles, for instance, was called Ἀτθὶς μέλισσα.

6 Matinae, Apulian‚ cf. 1. 28. 3. Calabrian honey is praised in 111.
1 . 23.

28. more modoque, a formula common in Latin, like Art und
Weise in German and ‘shape or form' in English. 1t is practically a
hendiadys for ‘ customary style.’

30. plurimum, doubtless with laborem, not with nemus as Bentley

took it (meaning ‘ dense grove ’). The contrast is between Pindar soaring
easily on high and Horace working laboriously near the ground.

uvidi, cf. 1. 7. 14, 111. 29. 6.
31. ripas, absolutely, as in 111. 25. 13.

32. fingo, ‘build.' The verb would apply also to the construction
of honeycombs.

33. concines. ‘You shall sing >to the lyre.' Lachmann’s emenda·
tion concinet would be an improvement, sor concines suggests that Horace
is putting Antonius into that rivalry with Pindar which he has already
declared to be absurd and impossible. But cf. 1. 6 where Horace assigns
to Varius a task which he declines himself on the ground that rivalry
with Homer is impossible.

, maiore plectro, probably abl. of description with poeta: ‘ poet of a
ffiiglllitier igin! It may however be taken with concines. For plectro

34. quandoque=quandocunque as in lv. r. 17. The ode ap-
parently was written some weeks before Caesar's return (J uly 13.c. 13).

35. per sacrum olivum, ‘down the sacred hill’ i.e. the Via Sacra
, which descends a slope just before it reaches the Forum.

36. fronde, the laurel-wreath: but see the note on lv. 3. 7.

Sygambri, a tribe of N. Germany, between the Rhine and the Lippe.
They crossed the Rhine and defeated M. Lollius in B.c. 16. Augustus,
on receiving this news, set out for Gaul and stayed there three years.

37. quo niml maius etc., cf. Epist. 11. 1. 17 where the people
praise Augustus nil oriturum alias, nil ortum tale fatentes.

39. dabunt: donabunt would be more usual, cf. vis rapuit rapietque,
11. 13. 2ο, colendi et culti, C. S. 2. There is a slight difference between
dare and donare: cf. Cic. Verr. IV. 16. 36 multa aliis· data atque donata.

42. ludum, i.e. gladiatorial games.

impetrato, obtained by prayers. There are extant coins of B.c. 16
bearing the inscription S. P. Q. R. V. S. (vota suscepta) PRO S. (salute)
ET RE». (reditu) AVo. There are also coins of B.c. 13 with the in-
scription FORTVNAE Rssovcz.
