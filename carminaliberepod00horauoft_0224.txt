180 HORACE, ODES 1. xvi, xvii.

12. Iuppiter, ‘the sky.’ Cf. 1. 1. 25 note.
ruens, ‘ tumbling.' Cf. ruit arduus aether Verg. Georg. 1. 3²4·

13—16. The legend is not found in any other author. The con-
struction may be either (1) fertur P. coactus (esse) addere...et apposuisse,
etc. or (2) fertur P. (coactus addere...) et apposuisse, where et=etiam:
or (3) fertur P. coactus addere (for addidisse) et apposuisse, etc. The

third is the most likely: cf. 111. πο. 11--13 posuisse..fertur et recreare,
and Propertius 111. 14. 9 capere arma...fertur nec erubuisse.

13. principi limo, ‘to the original clay,' from which Prom. made
the first man and woman.

14. undique, from all other animals.

16. stomacho, not ‘ anger' as in 1. 6. 6, but the actual stomach, as
the seat of anger. The English ‘ spleen' conveys both ideas.

17. Thyesten. It is not known to what form of the Pelopid
legend Horace is alluding. In the versions known to us, Atreus
perished exitio gravi but not Thyestes.

18. urbibus, dat.

ultimae, remotest, and so ‘ original.’

19. stetere, in prose usually exstitere: ‘ have been.’

20. imprimeretque muris, etc. It was a Roman custom, after

destroying the walls of a city, to run a plough over the site of them, as
a symbol that the land was henceforth sarm-land and not town-land.
Carthage was so treated in Rc. 146.

22. compesce mentem. So in Epist. 1. 2. 63 ira furor brevis est.
animum rege...lzunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catena. Both mens and
animus would'seem to mean ‘first impulse.’

2 3. temptavit, ‘ attacked,’ used of a disease, as in Verg. Georg. 111.
441 turpis oves temptat scabies.

24. iambos, doubtless Horace refers to the Epodes, which he
himself calls iambi (Epod. 14. 7) and which were certainly among his
earliest works (see Introd. p. xii).

celeris iambos, cf. Ars Poet. 251 syllaba longa brevi subiecta vocatur
iambus, Pes citus. Iambics, with their rapid rhythm‚ are suited to
impetuous utterance.

α 5. mitibus, abl. of mitia. mutare, in the sense ‘to exchange‚’ is
constructed with an accus. and an instr. abl„ the thing given up being in
the one case, the thing taken in the other. Here the thing given up is

in accus„ the thing taken in the abl. But in the next ode, ll. 1 and 2,
the opposite constr. is used.

mitibus tristia, ‘ sours for sweets‚’ both adjs. having ref. to taste.

26. dum=dummodo, ‘ if only,’ as in the famous phrase oderint dum

metuant (Cic. de Off 1. 28. 97), cs. the use of si with subj. in the sense
‘in the hope that.'

> 27. recantatis. recantare is literally to ‘ unsing,’ to withdraw
something already sung. Cf. reprobo.

28. animum, sc. tuum. Cf. animum reddere amoribus in 1. 19. 4.
