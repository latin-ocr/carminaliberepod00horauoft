164 HORACE, ODES 1. vi, vii.

16. Tydiden. Diomedes, who, at the instigation of Pallas Athene,
wounded Ares and Aphrodite in battle. Iliad v. 881-884. ·

18. sectis, ‘pared' so that they do not hurt. Bentley proposed
stn'ctis, as if unguibus were substituted in joke for ensibus. He com-
pares Ovid Am. 1. 6. 14 non timeo strictas in mea fata manus and
Statius T heb. 111. 5 37 (of eagles) strictis ung-uibus instant.

19. vacui, ‘ fancy-free.'
20. non praeter=secundum‚ ‘ according to my wont.'
leves, ‘light-hearted.'

Ode Vll.

To L. Munatius Plancus (born about B.c. 85), who served as legatus
of Julius Caesar in Gaul, was consul B.c. 42, and governed Asia and
Syria for Antony but ultimately joined Octavian. It was he who
proposed in the senate that Octavian should receive the cognomen of
Augustus (B.c. 27). “

Scheme. Other poets may celebrate other places, but I love Tibur
best of all. Plancus, when you are at Tibur, do not forget the soothing
influence of wine. Teucer, when he sared forth into exile, drowned his
sorrows in wine.

[The transitions in this Ode are so abrupt that many readers in
’ ancient times divided it into two poems, consisting of ll. 1-14 and
15-32. It would seem that Plancus was going to Tibur for a holiday
and that he was suffering from some illness or anxiety sor which wine
was, in Horace's judgment, a good remedy.]

Metre. The Alcmanian strophe, consisting of dactylic hexameters
and tetrameters. (The metre is used again only in 1. 28 and Epod. η.)

1. laudabunt. The permissive future (cf. 1. 6. 1) = laudent licet, cf.
linquet in 111. 23. 12 and Vergil Aen. vl. 848 excudent alii spirantia
mollius aera,...tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.

alaram, ‘sunny.’ Cf. Pliny JV. H. 11. 62 Rhodi et Syracusis nun-
quam tanta nubila obduci ut non aliqua hora sol cernatur.

aut...aut. Three eastern places are distinguished with aut, then
three western places are distinguished with ve or vel, but vel is not used
with Tempe apparently because Tempe is also locus insignis Apolline.

3· Baccho...Apomne‚ abl. of the means with insignis, like clari
giganteo triumpho in 111. ι. 7.

4. -·1·empe. A Greek neut. plur. indeclinable. For the connexion
of Tempe with Apollo cf. 1. 21. 9.

5. sunt quibus...est, cf. 1. 1. 3.
intactae, ‘ virgin.’ Cf. integra Diana in 111. 4. 70.
Palladis urbem. Athens.

6. carmine perpetuo, ‘an unbroken strain,' i. e. a long continuous
composition. Thus Ovid (Metam. 1. 4) speaks of his Metamorphoses
(about 12000 lines) as perpetuum carmen.
